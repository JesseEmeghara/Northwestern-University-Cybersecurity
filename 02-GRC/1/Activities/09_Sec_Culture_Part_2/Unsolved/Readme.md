## Activity File: Security Culture Framework – Part 2

In this activity, you'll complete the action plan that you began drafting for your client in the first activity.

### Instructions

Draft a plan specifing the following details:

1. **Make an Action Plan:** Identify your "plan of attack." For example, you might propose to implement a training, implement stricter security controls, or some combination of the two. 

2. **Schedule:** Determine timelines for implementing your plan. Be specific: Explain what will get done in terms of quarterly or annual goals.

3. **Metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs):** Explain what you will measure to determine if your plan has been successful. Specify KPIs indicating what you want your plan to achieve. These are your planned goals.

4. **Measurements:** Explain how you will measure the success of your plan. Specify both when and how you'll measure results. 
    - Be detailed. For instance, if you're going to contract a pentesting company, explain exactly what you'll have them do.

During review, you'll discuss an example solution to this problem. However, there are many good answers, so don't hesitate to be creative. Do remember to justify every decision you make.
