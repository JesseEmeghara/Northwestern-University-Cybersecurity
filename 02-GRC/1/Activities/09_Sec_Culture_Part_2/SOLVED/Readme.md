## Solution Guide: Security Culture Framework - Part 2

In this activity, you had to complete the action plan that you began drafting for your client in the first activity.

Below is a sample solution.

---

1. **Action Plan:**   
    - Schedule quarterly trainings.

    - Design and develop training.

    - Implement quarterly training.

    - Evaluate impact after each training.

    - Evaluate overall impact after one year.
  
2. **Schedule:** The security and HR teams decided that quarterly trainings made the most sense.

3. **Metrics and KPIs:** The security team wants 0% of employees to allow tailgating after the training is complete.

4. **Measurements:** One month after each quarter's training, security personnel will audit security cameras and identify employees who allow others to tailgate. 

    - Those who have already been through training will be disciplined. Those who follow training guidelines will be rewarded. Those who have not yet been trained will be notified that they should stop, but they will not be disciplined.
