## Activity File: Implementing Security Controls

In this activity, you will draft the final piece of recommendations submitted to GeldCorp.

- You've already developed a full training plan, with target dates and a suggested delegation structure. However, training won't address the problem in the short term: It will take at least a quarter to train just 25% of the company. Improving the organization's security culture is a valuable long-term outcome, but the issue also needs to be mitigated immediately.

- The training plan is a personnel security measure, and won't drastically reduce tailgating rates until at least next year. 

- Consider physical, technical, or procedural controls that would immediately reduce employee tailgaiting.

### Instructions

Record three different controls of any type. Answer the following questions about each control:

  - How does this reduce tailgating?

  - What is the cost of implementation?

  - What percentage reduction in tailgaiting rates do you expect?

**Note:** GeldCorp is well funded. They are willing to invest in innovative solutions to the problem. Be realistic and justify your suggestions, but if, for instance, you are interested in using complex biometrics or other such systems, budget is not a concern.

Be sure to ask your instructors and classmates for help if you get stuck.
