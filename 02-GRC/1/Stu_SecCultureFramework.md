## Security Culture Framework Steps

- **Step 1:** The Security Culture Framework (SCF) Team meets privately to assess the impact of the phishing incident and understand the risk future phishing campaigns pose to the organization. This discussion includes:

  - An assessment of the damages incurred by the previous phishing incident.

  - A measurement of how many employees download malicious files, obtained by having a pentesting firm launch a phishing attack against the company. This assessment might find a 10% click-through rate, meaning that 10% of employees download malicious email attachments.

  - Setting a target click-through rate. The team might decide that a 5% click-through rate is acceptable.

- **Step 2:** The SCF Team Manager (in this case, the IR manager) meets with the CISO to explain that the previous phishing attack was successful because 10% of employees often download arbitrary files from arbitrary email addresses. They request a budget to execute a plan to bring this number down to 5% and explain how this would be profitable for the business.

- **Step 3:** The SCF Team develops a training plan to educate employees.

  - In addition, the SCF Team develops a Supplemental Security Awareness training plan. This plan will be delivered only to employees who continue to click malicious links after training.

- **Step 4:** After developing the training, the SCF Team decides on incentives and disincentives, which will be awarded based on how employees behave during penetration tests and security audits. Since employees won't know exactly when these assessments are being conducted, the team expects greater adherence to the new download guidelines.

  - **Incentives:** Incentives for for not clicking through during the assessment include a $40 gift card, free or discounted security conference attendance, and additional vacation time.

  - **Disincentives:** Disincentives for for not clicking through during the assessment include supplemental security awareness training and additional random device audits for one quarter.

- **Step 5:** The SCF Team collaborates with HR to determine the best dates to run trainings. During these meetings, the HR Team explains that the most reliable way to ensure 100% attendance over the next fiscal year is to have quarterly training sessions, training 25% of employees each time. SCF and HR coordinate the specific dates and location of the training.

- **Step 6:** The SCF Team collaborates with Communications to develop and distribute information about the training.

- **Step 7:** The SCF Team sets up and runs the training as scheduled.

- **Step 8:** Every quarter, the SCF Team contracts the same pentesting firm to run the phishing campaign against all employees who have already been trained.

- **Step 9:** After every test, the SCF Team identifies employees who still clicked malicious links, and requires them to go through Supplemental Security Awareness training. In addition, they verify whether the click-through rate drops closer to 5%.

- **Step 10:** After training the entire company, the SCF Team runs a final phishing campaign to evaluate the overall effectiveness of the training. If they find that the click-through rate is 5% or lower, it can be considered a success. Otherwise, they may decide to run the training for an additional year, or take a different approach to solving the problem.
