## Week 2 Module README: Governance, Risk, and Compliance

### Module Description

This module, Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), introduces organizational security by providing a holistic impression of how different security fields connect with one another and with the overall needs of an organization. 

We'll explore how effective security controls at various levels of an organization can create a healthy security culture. We will also perform risk analysis and threat modeling in order to conceptualize, quantify, and communicate the risk of threats to the proper managerial stakeholders. 

In the final class, we will expand our coverage of organizational security by discussing policy, compliance, and business continuity planning.

    - Identify threat agents, possible attacks, and exploitable vulnerabilities relevant to a given asset.

    - Prioritize risks based on likelihood and impact potential.

    - Choose and justify controls for a given risk. 


- **Day 3:** Governance Frameworks, Compliance, and BCP/DR

    - Explain how organizations use policy and procedure to formalize standards of "right" and "wrong."

### What to Be Aware Of

- On Day 2, we will be using the OWASP threat modeling approach of cyber risk management and threat modeling.

  - We will use a macro-enabled, risk analysis spreadsheet that includes a heat map: [Risk Analysis Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gwNSDxTnVOv7d8PXXZCjZl00ymtKwQjkWCKD1IaMC-A/edit#gid=1384626883)

  - Editing access is not available for this document. In order to work in this file, you will need to make a copy by navigating to File > Make a copy...

  - When creating the heat map, only add probability and impact values of 10, 20, 30 or 40.  Otherwise, the heat map will malfunction.

### Module 2: Challenge Assignment

This module's Challenge assignment can be found in Canvas.
- For this module’s Challenge, students will research some of the specific security risks that a fictional organization faces and use the security culture framework to develop a plan to mitigate these concerns.


### Going Forward

Next week we will start getting technical! In the Terminal and Bash module, you will work on the command line and learn how to navigate directories, modify files, and more.
