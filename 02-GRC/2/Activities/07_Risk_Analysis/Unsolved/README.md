## Activity File: Threat Modeling Step 5: Risk Analysis

In this activity, you’ll use the threats you identified in the previous activity to complete a quantitative risk assessment. 

- You will out a spreadsheet with the identified risks and use it to generate a risk matrix and heat map for GeldCorp.


#### Risk Template

Access the spreadsheet here: 

- [Risk Analysis Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gwNSDxTnVOv7d8PXXZCjZl00ymtKwQjkWCKD1IaMC-A/edit#gid=1384626883) 

Complete this activity using Google Sheets.

**Note**: You cannot edit this file. You will need to make a copy.

- Select **File** > **Make a Copy**.

You can access the following tabs at the bottom of the document: 

  - **Risk Assessment Data:** Contains descriptions of each risk, as well as probability and impact ratings.

  - **Risk Matrix:** Matrix displaying how many risks of each severity level you’ve identified.
  
  - **Heat Map:** Chart displaying whether you should make-do, monitor, manage, or mitigate each risk.

  - **Risk Ratings:** Information on GeldCorp’s risk rating guidelines.

### Instructions

1. In the **Risk Assessment Data** tab, add the most critical risks that you identified in the previous activity. 

   - Fill out the risk description, probability, and impact cells for each risk.

   - :warning: When creating your heat map, only choose **probability** and **impact** values of 10, 20, 30 or 40.  Otherwise, the heat map will malfunction.

2. Next, consider less critical risks. Add at least five additional risks that are medium or high impact, but are not very likely.
 
3. When you have at least ten risks, move on to the **Risk Matrix** tab and take a moment to assess Geldcorp's risks. 

4. Move on to the **Heat Map**. Scroll down and click the **Update Chart Data and Labels** button on the left. Answer the following questions:

    - Which risks should you mitigate?
      
    - Which risks should you manage?

    - Which risks should you monitor?

    - Do these results align with your expectations?
