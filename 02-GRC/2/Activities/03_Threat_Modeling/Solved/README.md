## Solution Guide: Threat Modeling: Steps 1–4

In this activity, you applied the first four steps of the threat modeling process to a business scenario.

- **Step 1**: Determine assessment scope

    - We completed Step 1 by reading the provided information and familiarized ourselves with the assessment scope.  

- **Step 2:** List three threat agents relevant to the intranet.

    - Script kiddies

    - Organized cybercriminals

    - Insider threats

- **Step 3:** List three potential attacks against the intranet.

    - **Phishing:** An attacker might try to gain access to the private intranet by phishing employees.

    - **Malware:** Attackers might use malware to infect the intranet. For example, they may infect it with ransomware.

    - **Physical attacks:** Attackers might be able to gain physical access to the building.


- **Step 4:** Identify three possible vulnerabilities in the intranet, and rank them in order of severity. Explain how each one could be exploited.

    - **No content filter:** Employees can download files from any site they want. This makes it much easier for attackers to introduce malware.

    - **Poor access control policies:** Every employee in a department should not have access to all of that department's data.

    - **Older workstations:** Windows 7/8 machines are more vulnerable than newer versions.

### Bonus: Web Application Infrastructure 

- List three threat agents relevant to the web application:

    - **Script kiddies** are a risk to any website. They are unsophisticated and don't have a lot of money, so they're fairly harmless, unless there are easily exploitable vulnerabilities in the client-side web application.

    - **Organized cybercriminals** might specifically target GeldCorp because they manage money and equity transfers. These attackers are well-motivated and skilled enough to identify and exploit subtle security holes.

    - **Insider threats** are worth considering. Recall that all employees in a given department can access all of that department's data. This means that an engineer on the front-end web team would be able to read the code behind the automated trading algorithms, which the company considers top secret. This is a problem, because that engineer can now leak those secrets, even though he didn't need access to them in the first place.


- List three attacks that threat agents might attempt against the web application. Explain what the attacker gains from the attack.

    - **DDoS:** The trading platform must respond to the market in real time. Taking down the web application through a DDoS attack would have serious impact on the business's reputation. This is most likely to come from script kiddies.

    - **Dumping the database:** Attackers might attempt to use SQL injection to dump the database to steal social security numbers. Script kiddies and more sophisticated attackers might both try this attack.

    - **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** With cross site scripting, an attacker can execute malicious code into a vulnerable web page.  Depending on the code,  attackers can execute a number of attacks, including the transmission of sensitive data such as cookies and session information, redirecting the victim to malicious web content, or compromising the victim’s machine.

- Identify three possible vulnerabilities in the web application infrastructure, and rank them in order of severity. Explain how each one could be exploited.

    - The **app server** is probably vulnerable to XSS vulnerabilities. These can be used to steal user cookies and hijack their sessions.

    - The **database** is probably vulnerable to SQL injection. This could be exploited to dump confidential PII.

        - GeldCorp did not state that the database was encrypted. If attackers dump the database, they'll immediately have access to confidential PII in plaintext.
