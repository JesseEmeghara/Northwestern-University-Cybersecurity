## Activity File: Enumeration with traceroute

In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a security analyst at Acme Corp.

- CompuCom, a software company, hires Acme Corp to do a security assessment of its network.

- CompuCom requests that you further analyze the IPs rejected in the last activity to determine where in their path the connection is being dropped. 

### Instructions

   1. Run `traceroute`, or `tracert` for Windows, against the IP addresses from the last activity that returned a failed response.
   
   2. Determine where in their transmission (at which hop) the transmission failed.
     
   3. Document a summary of your findings to be provided to CompuCom using a [traceroute mapping tool](https://stefansundin.github.io/traceroute-mapper/) to convey the path of the traffic.
