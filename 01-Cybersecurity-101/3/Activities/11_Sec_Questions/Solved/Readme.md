## Solution Guide: Security+ Sample Questions

---

**Question 1**

  - Which of the following threat actors or threat actor groups is most likely to have the best funding to hire and sustain a group of cybercriminals?

    - **Solution:** Nation states

  - Extended Explanation:

    - Nation states have tax revenues, backing from large companies, and wealthy benefactors who fund malicious activities.

    - Well-funded organized criminals do not have the resources of an entire nation behind them.

    - Script kiddies do not have any funding because they are typically young and inexperienced and do not qualify for any backing.

    - Hacktivist groups might have minor funding from opposing viewpoint factions but the funding is not significant or comparable to nation states.

**Question 2**

  - Which feature of insider threat actors makes them especially dangerous to an organization?

    - **Solution:** They have unrestricted access to sensitive data and information.

  - Extended Explanation:

    - Insider actors are so dangerous because they have unrestricted access to sensitive data and information. Someone with appropriate access can then easily steal or leak that data.

    - Insiders prefer to stay in stealth mode and an advanced persistent threat (APT) would give away their intent.

    - A hacktivist would oppose the organization’s political or ideological goals. An insider would never reveal this oppositional nature.

    - Script kiddies use prebuilt or canned programs for attacks. Such attacks would likely give away the insider’s position and intent.

**Question 3**

  - Of the several types of threat actors, which one is a novice with little experience as a hacker?

    - **Solution:** Script kiddie

  - Extended Explanation:

    - Script kiddies have very limited knowledge of security but use automated tools, such as scripts, to hack systems.
    
    - A hacktivist is a hacker who gains access to systems or other resources to disrupt operations based on ideological differences with the target.
    
    - An insider is someone who hacks internal systems in a company who has or had access to restricted materials.
    
    - A competitor may attempt to hack, compromise, or sabotage another company or an individual’s work to gain a competitive edge.

**Question 4**

  - Which threat actor is most likely to be highly skilled in launching attacks involving APTs against targets?
  
    - **Solution:** Nation state
  
  - Extended Explanation:

    - A nation state has the most sophisticated and highly skilled hackers available for launching APTs. 
    
    - A script kiddie is not highly skilled nor capable of launching APTs against targets. 
    
    - An insider can be highly skilled but does not use APTs because these would give away their positions and intent. 
    
    - Organized crime rings are highly skilled but they do not launch APTs against a target. 

**Question 5**

  - A group known as Takedown hacked into your political action committee website and defaced it. Which type of threat actor is most likely responsible for the attack?

    - Solution: **Hacktivist**
  
  - Extended Explanation:

    - Takedown is a hacktivist group. Its motivations seem political and it is interested in defacing websites of those who have opposing viewpoints from their own. 
    
    - Script kiddies typically do not deface websites, only using scripts and applications that help them break into systems or applications with known vulnerabilities. 
    
    - Although a malicious insider might have the ability to deface the site, it’s unlikely that they would do so. Insiders usually exfiltrate data rather than deface sites.
    
    - It’s unlikely that a competitor would deface the site. They would more likely search for a list of donors or other sensitive information.

**Question 6**

  - What aspect of cybercrime often motivates script kiddies to hack into systems or into a company?
  
    - **Solution:** Bragging rights, publicity, or some other form of notoriety.
  
  - Extended Explanation:

    - Script kiddies generally only want to be able to tell their friends that they have hacked some company, or want their names mentioned on the news. 
   
    - Script kiddies are not generally profit seekers because they do not have the resources to acquire or sell stolen items. 
   
    - Script kiddies are not involved with government entities or agencies and therefore do not seek this type of information or activity. 
   
    - Private or secret information motivates insiders to become threats. Script kiddies do not gain profits by having access to private or secret information. 

**Question 7**

  - Which of the following motivates a hacktivist to perpetrate a website defacing or an informational breach?
    
    - **Solution:** Reputation damage to the target.
  
  - Extended Explanation:

    - Hacktivists are interested in damaging or exposing their ideological opposition but not generally for monetary gain or other accolades. 
    
    - Hacktivists are primarily concerned with damaging the reputations of their targets. 
   
    - Hacktivists have no interest in military tactics or political upheaval. Their interest is purely ideological. 
   
    - A boost in recognition is only important to script kiddies who want to show off to friends or rival script kiddie groups.
