## Activity File: CIA Triad and Security Scenarios

Analyze the brief security scenarios below and identify which element of the CIA triad (confidentiality, availability, or integrity) each situation is concerned with. 

### Scenarios

1. A hospital only allows authorized healthcare personnel within one department to access patient Personal Identifiable Information. When employees move to another department, they lose access.

2. A technology firm maintains an alternate site that is running at all times. Operations can be moved to this location in the event of a major disaster.

3. Employees need key cards in order to enter their company offices.

4. A company hashes their data files to monitor whether information has been tampered with. 

5. Only authorized personnel at a company have write access to certain files. All other employees have only read access to these files. 

6. A company employs redundant servers, which means that systems are duplicated. In the event of a malfunction, one server will step in for the other.

7. A company's network infrastructure uses load balancers, which distribute the "load" of tasks, such as file requests and data routing, to a variety of servers. This ensures that no single device is overburdened.

8. A cybercriminal uses a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept wireless traffic from users. 

9. A cybercriminal cracks a hashed message and changes its contents. 

10. A cybercriminal launches a DDoS attack that floods a website with unwanted traffic from multiple computers and takes the site offline.
