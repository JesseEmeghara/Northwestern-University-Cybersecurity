## Module 1 README: Security 101

### Module Description

Welcome! This document is a weekly module README. It provides an overview of the module, along with technical lab information, useful resources, and links to Challenge homework assignments. Students will see a version of this document in Canvas for each module.

- In this module, we will become familiar with the structure of the course and learn about some of the tools and topics that this course will cover. We will cover fundamental cybersecurity concepts, like the CIA triad, and work in groups to assess attack and defense strategies of vulnerable data. 

- On the final day of this module, we will focus on professional pathways by studying cybersecurity certifications, domains, and professions.

### What to Be Aware Of

- Throughout the course, we will use features on Zoom and Slack to optimize the online learning experience. These tools include breakout rooms for group activities and class polls to assess comprehension after activities. 

- On Day 3, we will cover cybersecurity professional pathways and certifications. It is perfectly okay if students do not have a strong sense of the specific pathways they would like to pursue at this time. Over the next 24 weeks, this boot camp will present a wide scope of cybersecurity skills and domains, giving them the opportunity to narrow down what interests and motivates them.


### Security+ Domains

On Day 3 of this module, we will introduce the Security+ exam and its domains. In the coming modules, we will provide details about other domains covered on the exam. 

For more information about these Security+ domains, refer to the following resource:

### Module 1: Challenge Assignment

This module's Challenge assignment can be found in Canvas.
- For this module’s Challenge, students will review three real-world cybersecurity reports and answer questions about each.


### Looking Forward 

The next module will cover governance, risk, and compliance—three fundamental concepts security teams use to instill strong security controls and a healthy security culture within organizations. 

We will examine how a security team interacts with the larger business organization, and identify and prioritize attacks and vulnerabilities through risk management and threat modeling frameworks. We will also learn about various regulations and laws that inform the policies that security teams enforce.
