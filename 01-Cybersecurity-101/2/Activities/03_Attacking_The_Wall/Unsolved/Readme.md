## Activity File: Security Task #1 - Attacking the Wall

In this activity, you will examine various attack strategies that cybercriminals can use to penetrate an insecure login. 

- You and your team have just been hired by a very successful startup, Bitcoin Dating Exchange. 

- While their founding team is brilliant, like many startups, they don’t know the first thing about security.

- They have just handed you a lot of money to solve their most critical problem: their login process is totally insecure. Malicious actors are routinely logging in as users (and administrators) and gaining access to company data and financial assets.

### Instructions

In groups, develop a list of 15 ways that a malicious actor could penetrate the system and login as a user or administrator.

With each method, be prepared to describe the following:

  - Who (or what) is the initial target?

  - How would the actor implement the attack?

Save your answers. You will need them for the next activity too.   

#### Hints

- While you may be new to this type of thinking, this exercise should force you to think creatively about all the ways a system can be penetrated, from user attacks to physical break ins. 

- To successfully complete this exercise, you must think through creative options. Brainstorm and discuss with your group to devise real-world attack types. 

As always, be prepared to share your answers!
