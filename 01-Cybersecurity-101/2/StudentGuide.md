## 1.2 Student Guide: Attacking and Defending

### Overview

Today, students assess attack and defense strategies of a vulnerable web login.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class you will be able to:

- List different types of user, web, server, and database cybersecurity attacks.

- Identify risk mitigation plan frameworks for user, web, server, and database cybersecurity attacks.

### 01. Instructor Do: Welcome and Overview  (0:15)

- In the previous class you were introduced to the structure of the course and the staff who will support them. We also covered the rise of cybersecurity, the boot camp's course overview, and the technical infrastructures we will use to complete labs. Finally, you were introduced the fundamental cybersecurity concept of the CIA triad. 

Cybersecurity focuses on two primary concepts:

  - **Threat assessment:** The structured process of identifying the threats posed to a group or system.

  - **Risk mitigation:** The systematic reduction of the impact and likely occurrence of a negative event.

Why do we use the word "mitigation" and not "eradication"? 

- **Answer:** we cannot eradicate all risks. Since cybersecurity is an ever-evolving landscape, new threats emerge every day. Also, business needs and budgetary constraints often limit the ability to implement cybersecurity best practices. So we must do our best to mitigate.

#### Today's Topics

Today's class will continue with assessing risk and mitigating threats by evaluating specific attacks and vulnerabilities of users, web applications, servers, and databases. In short, you will be thinking about ways to attack and defend pillars of organizations in order to access and protect valuable information. 

**In today's class**, you will have the opportunity to think like offensive and defensive cybersecurity professionals evaluating the attacks and defenses of levels of information within a company.  

- To assess threats and mitigate risks, you need to check each component of an organization, and understand how malicious actors can exploit weaknesses within the organization and damage the stakeholders' finances, reputations, and well-being. 

### 02. Instructor Do: Introducing Security Task #1 - The Stolen IPhone (0:07)

We will dive right into our first activity to understand the "security mindset" 

- You just found an unattended Iphone left at the table in a restaurant

- The phone is not locked with a password, and every feature and app is accessible 

In groups, develop a list of 5–10 ways that a malicious actor could maliciously use this phone. You should:

- Think creatively; 

- Think like a malicious actor; and

- Point out that not all malicious acts are technical.

### 03. Student Do: Security Task #1 - The Stolen IPhone (0:20)

### 04.  Instructor Review: Security Task #1 - The Stolen IPhone (0:20)

The purpose of this activity had several purposes:

- To practice creative thinking

- To understand that thinking like a cyber criminal, can help cyber professionals determine mitigation methods.

- To determine different types of potential vulnerabilities.

- Explain that these all make up the **Security Mindset**.

### 05. Instructor Do: Introducing Security Task #2 - Attacking the Wall (0:07)

You will now work on two security tasks related to assessing threats and mitigating risks. 

In this next activity, you will continue to use the security mindset, but focus on technical systems which are common with many organizations.

  - You will examine various **attack** strategies that cybercriminals can use to penetrate insecure logins. 

- This exercise should force you to think creatively about all the ways to penetrate a system, from user attacks to physical break-ins. 

- To successfully complete this exercise, you must think through creative options. You will experience a real sense of accomplishment when they discover real-world attack types through discussion and brainstorming. 

Using the slides, review the scenario

- You and your team have just been hired by a very successful startup, Bitcoin Dating Exchange. 

- While their founding team is brilliant, like many startups, they don’t know the first thing about security.

- They have just handed you a lot of money to solve their most critical problem: their log-in process is totally insecure. Malicious attackers are routinely logging in as users (and administrators) and gaining access to company data and financial assets.

In groups, develop a list of 15 ways that a malicious actor could penetrate the system and log in as a user or administrator.

- With each method, be prepared to describe the following:

  - Who (or what) is the initial target?

  - How would the actor implement the attack?

### 06. Student Do: Security Task #2 - Attacking the Wall (0:20)

### 07.  Instructor Review: Security Task #2 - Attacking the Wall (0:20)

Now that we have evaluated all the threats posed to this company, we will consider how to mitigate the risks.   

### 08. Group Do: Security Task #3 - Defending the Wall (0:20)

In the same groups, you will now use their list of potential attacks from the previous activity to develop a list of at least 10 strategies to mitigate the website's risk. 

- The goal of this exercise is for you to realize that they can use certain mitigation strategies to handle multiple threats at once.

- You should arrive at 10 or more strategies total that address the concerns.

### 09.  Instructor Review: Security Task #3 - Defending the Wall (0:15)
