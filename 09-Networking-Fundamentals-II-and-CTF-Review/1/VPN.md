  - As an example, they may be travelling and far from where their LAN is located.
  - Or their LAN is located in an office and they are working at home.
  
- Explain that fortunately there are remote connectivity devices and systems that enable these remote users access to their local networks by accessing them across the internet.

- Explain that there are many remote connectivity technologies that they may already be familiar with, such as:
  - **Dial Up**: Dial up systems used a phone line and a modem to connect a user to the internet.
  - **DSL**: Digital subscriber line (DSL) is a higher speed method to connect a user to the internet over phone lines.
  - **Cable**: Since cable companies were already connected in most homes, users connected to the internet through cable companies coaxial and fiber lines.
  
- Explain the challenge of those **remote connectivity technologies** is that connecting to the internet is not always safe.
  - For example, unencrypted transmitted data could be potentially captured by hackers.
  
- Explain that fortunately there is a technology called **a virtual private network (VPN)**, which creates a safer encrypted connection across the less secure network such as the internet.

- Explain how **VPN** works by covering the following:
  - VPN's encrypt the data on the sending end, and decrypt it on the receiving end.
  - They create a "Tunnel" across the less secure networks, that only authorized users can access.
  - The users become authorized by using an authentication factor, such as a password.
  
- VPN's are often used by remote employees to access a company's resources within the company's LAN securely.
