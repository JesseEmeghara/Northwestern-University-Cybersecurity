## Activity File: Credential Access

In this activity, you will use your SYSTEM access on the domain controller to make a copy of the `NTDS.dit` file and attempt to crack the password hashes in it.

⚠️ **Reminder** - Don't forget to save your findings, as you will add them to your week 17 Homework!


### Instructions

Use your Meterpreter session on the WINDC01 machine (the domain controller). If you do not have an active session on the WINDC01 machine, refer to prior activities.

1. In Meterpreter, enter a shell, then view the users on the machine via the `net` command.

2. Exit the command shell, then load `kiwi` and perform `dcsync_ntlm` in Meterpreter for each of the users. Run the command `dcsync_ntlm` to see the usage.

3. Take each NTLM hash and place them in a text file. Using `john`, crack the hashes in the file.
