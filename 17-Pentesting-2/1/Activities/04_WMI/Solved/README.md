## Activity File: WMI

In this activity, you leveraged two sets of credentials and used a Metasploit command in order to run commands on the remote machine.

### Instructions

1. In Ubuntu, open a terminal 

2. You will use the python command `wmiexec.py`
   - Here is a sample command:  `sudo wmiexec.py sampledomain/user:'Password'@192.1.20.10 whoami`
     - `sudo wmiexec.py`  - Runs the python command as sudo
     - `sampledomain/user:` - sampledomain is the Domain  and User is the user are attempting to login with
     - `'Password'@192.1.20.10` - Password is that user's password, and 192.1.20.10 is the ip of the server you are trying to access
     - `whoami` - is the windows command you will be running on the target machine
       
3. Update the sample command with the domain, user, password, and IP for the user `tstark`
  
4. Run the command of: `sudo wmiexec.py megacorpone/tstark:'Password'@172.22.117.20 whoami` You should see the output "megacorpone\tstark."


5. Change the whoami command to list the processes. 
   
     -  `sudo wmiexec.py sampledomain/user:'Password'@192.1.20.10 tasklist`

     - Your output should show the list of processes

6. Using other commands, answer the following questions(Note that results may vary):

	1. What is the version and build number of Windows?
    
		  - `systeminfo`
		  - 10.0.19042 Build 19042
	
	2. What processor architecture is the machine?
	
		- `systeminfo`
		
		- x64
	
	3. Are there any users logged in?
		
		- `net session`
		
		- No
	
	4. What shares are available on the machine?
	
		- `net share`
		
		- C$, IPC$, ADMIN$
