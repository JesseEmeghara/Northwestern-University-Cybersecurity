## Solution File: Windows Port Scanning

In this activity, you reconducted scanning in order to determine if any Windows machines are on the network. 

- You used Nmap to scan the network once again, this time looking for any Windows machines. 

- This scan gave you an idea of what machines to target next. 

### Instructions

On your Kali machine, perform an Nmap scan of the network you're on, then answer a few questions. 

1. Perform `ip addr` to identify your IP address, and perform an Nmap scan on that subnet (/24) to identify all machines on that network.

2. Based on what you learned, answer the following questions:

	1. How many Windows machines are on the network?

          - Two machines
	
	2. What ports or services are open on the machines that suggest that they're Windows machines?

          - `445` `SMB`, `139` `RPC/SMB`, `3389` `RDP`, `88` `Kerberos`
	
	3. Can you tell which machine is the domain controller?

          - The machine with port `88` open is always the DC due to how Kerberos operates.
