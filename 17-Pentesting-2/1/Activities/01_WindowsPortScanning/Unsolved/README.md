## Activity File: Windows Port Scanning

In this activity, you'll continue to play the role of a pen tester conducting an engagement on MegaCorpOne. After compromising a Linux server in MegaCorpOne's internal network, you now turn your focus to Windows machines. Since it's been a week since the last port scan, we will reconduct scanning in order to determine if any Windows machines are on the network. Remember that Windows has different services and ports open.

- You will use Nmap to scan the network once again, this time looking for any Windows machines. 

- Windows machines always have unique ports open, and Nmap has the ability to infer the operating system based on the services running from these ports. 

- This scan will give you an idea of what machines to target next. 

⚠️ **Reminder** - Don't forget to save your findings, as you will add them to your week 17 Homework!

### Instructions

On your Kali machine, perform an Nmap scan of the network you're on, then answer a few questions. 

1. Perform `ip addr` to identify your IP address, and perform an Nmap scan on that subnet (/24) to identify all machines on that network.

2. Based on the result of your scan, answer the following questions:
	1. How many Windows machines are on the network?
	2. What ports or services are open on the machines that suggest that they're Windows machines?
	3. Can you tell which machine is the domain controller?
