## Activity File: The Final Report

Just as in a real-world scenario, you will complete a final report to present your findings. You will work with your team to fill out the report.

 - You will submit the final report as your Challenge deliverable for this week. Everything your group has completed in class should be included. What you do not finish today can be continued at home. 
 
 - Use the [Final Case Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H528_nPqhfp_eOCzvyviwx5U3M1NiPTGtIFaoQoANbY/copy) Google Doc template to complete your report. Before beginning, make a copy of this template. To allow everyone in the group to access and work on the document at the same time, give every student editing access. (**Note:** While you should complete this report as a group, each student must submit their own copy of the report for this week's Challenge deliverable.)

  - Use the following resource to help guide your work:

     - [iPhone Forensics - Important Files and Databases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10CWGqTvu09mrSn7Tg7xoKNWBrjeW1wCmXoqB58xYr0k/edit?usp=sharing) 

### Instructions

You've examined and documented quite a bit of information from the iPhone image file. Now, you will use that documentation to build a final report. 

1. First, fill out the following evidence worksheet to document the case's WiFi and GPS locations. You will add this, along with the Correspondence Worksheet, to the final report. 

    - [Location Information Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19ckQwWc2iPh7qzKVDnBAKoBS-DpVBCb2cFfAbLNrULk/copy)

    Your group can search for WiFi and GPS info in the following directories:

     - Find information about WiFi locations in `root/Library/Caches/locationd/consolidated.db`. 

       - **Note:** Input GPS coordinates into Google Maps to see the locations.

       - Refer to the following image as an example:

          ![A screenshot depicts coordinates input into Google Maps.](Images/Google-GPS.png) 

     - Find information related to WiFi and cell tower location information in `consolidated.db`.

2. Working in your group's copy of the report template, add content and details as indicated in each section.

   - You will rely on the Locations Information and Correspondence Evidence Worksheets that you've completed so far. Additionally, you can use the **iPhone Forensics - Important Files and Databases** resource to find and analyze more information that supports your case, such as voicemails or notes from the Notepad iPhone application. 

   - Be sure to add to the report a list of the equipment and tools that you used to gather and analyze the evidence. 

      - For example: Autopsy, the operating system (Kali Linux), text editors (Nano), etc.

Be prepared to discuss your preliminary findings with the class.
