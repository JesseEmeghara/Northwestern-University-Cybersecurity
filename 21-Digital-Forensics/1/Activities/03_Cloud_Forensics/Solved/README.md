## Solution Guide: Digital Forensics in the Cloud

 The goal of this activity was to demonstrate the challenges digital forensics investigators faced when dealing with cloud-based systems.

---
 
List at least four challenges associated with conducting a cloud forensics investigation.

- Answers will vary. They might include:


    - There is no physical access to the computer where the crime took place. The exact location of the data may be unknown.

    - If the crime takes place on a cloud server, a malicious user can claim that everyone in the world with internet access should be a suspect.

    - When the crime takes place on a cloud server, it's difficult to pinpoint where the victim's data ends and where data belonging to another company, which police do not have a warrant for, begins. 

    - Because it's typical for many people to use the same cloud server, there are service-level agreements that have to be recognized when dealing with other companies.

    - Volatile memory, such as RAM, will be lost if the cloud server is rebooted.

    - Mallory knew that some hardware and software had been shared by many users, allowing them to claim that their instance had been comprised by someone else.

    - Isolating and securing the evidence is challenging when data is located in multiple locations.

How do these challenges affect the chain of custody?
    
- It's difficult to pinpoint where exactly the breach occurred and on which cloud server. This also presents the problem of the cloud server being in another county's jurisdiction.

**Bonus**

- Provide at least one example of an existing solution used to address challenges present in cloud forensics cases. 

    - Answers will vary.

   - A relevant excerpt from the document follows: 
   
        Access to evidence: An existing solution is the Log-Based Model.  The drawback with this solution is that there may be issues when dealing with dynamic data.
