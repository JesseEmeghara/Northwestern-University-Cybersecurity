### 01. Welcome to Career Prep Week 

This week, we'll focus on preparing for your new career in cybersecurity. Over the past several weeks, we've covered many different career paths and opportunities within cyber, and now we'll explain how you can best position yourself to land one of these roles.

As the demand for cybersecurity professionals grows, employers want qualified individuals to fill an increasing number of roles. But it can be challenging for organizations to find qualified candidates who fit their needs. This week, we'll focus on strategies that you can implement to prepare for a new career and prove to employers that you have the required skills to handle these new responsibilities.  

#### Week Overview

The skills and tools that you've learned throughout this course are already preparing you to begin your cybersecurity career. But, while it would be nice if organizations were now lined up at the door handing out job offers, a competitive job market requires an additional set of skills. 

In the coming weeks, you'll need to apply not just your new cybersecurity skills but also job hunting skills that position you to get interviews and, eventually, job offers.

#### Day 1 Overview

An important first step of career development is demonstrating that you can perform the tasks that your desired job requires. And a good way to do this is to pass a certification exam. Employers can be sure that an individual with a certification has the necessary skills to perform specific tasks, so a certification can give potential employees an edge when searching for a new job.

- Certification is a good way to demonstrate knowledge in a particular field.
- As of April 2020, 44 organizations issue over 300 cybersecurity certifications, which cover 25 specialties and paths.
- Today's class will help prepare you for the Security+ certification.

- **Security+**
  - This course provides a voucher to take the Security+ exam upon eligible graduation. 
  - This week we will cover:
    - Test preparation tips.
    - The CompTIA CertMaster study tool. 
    - Performance-based questions (PBQs). 
    - Domains on the exam that are not covered in this course's curriculum.


### 02. Introduction to Information Security Certifications 

Certifications provide prospective professionals an advantage in the information security job market. They tell potential employers that the candidate has the specific skill sets needed to perform daily tasks associated on the job. Earning your certification has the following additional benefits:

1. Further education 
    - While preparing for a certification, even before the certification is formally awarded, individuals learn new skills related to the subjects covered in the certification. While achieving credentials is often the objective, the material learned studying for the exam can expand upon existing knowledge and improve job performance.
  
2. Networking 
    - Certifications often have national and local organizations that host meetings, conferences, seminars, and social events. These events can provide opportunities to network with peers in your field.   
  
3. Career advancement
    - Information security certifications can also place more established professionals in a stronger position to obtain a promotion or new role.

Cybersecurity professionals may pursue different types of certificates depending upon the stage of their career. It is important to understand that some certifications offer a path to more advanced or specialized certifications. Familiarity with these other certifications can provide you with insight into another cybersecurity professional's skill set and career path.
  
#### Types of InfoSec Certification   
  
We can break cyber certifications into three categories:

1. Beginner information security certifications. 

   - Entry level and foundational towards more advanced certificates. 
   - These certifications typically do not have minimum work requirements or prerequisite courses.
   - They typically cover a broad range of subjects.
   - Examples include **Security+**, **CEH**, and **GSEC**.

2. Advanced information security certifications, which are typically obtained after working in the industry for several years. While each certification varies, some require three to five years' experience.

   - Many of these certifications focus on security management.
   - These certifications typically have minimum work requirements and prerequisite courses.
   - They typically cover a broad range of subjects.
   - Examples include **CISSP** and **CISM**.

3. Specialized information security certifications, which are more advanced certifications. Security professionals obtain these after working in the industry for several years.

    - These certifications typically have minimum work requirements and prerequisite courses.
    - They typically cover specific subjects. For example:
        - **GIAC Certified Forensic Examiner (GCFE)** is specific to forensics professionals.
        - **Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP)** and **PenTest+** are specific to penetration testers.
    - Specialized certifications can be vendor or non-vendor specific. For example:
        - **OSCP** is a non-vendor-specific penetration testing certification.
        - **Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)** or **Cisco Cybersecurity Operations Associate (CBROPS)** is a vendor-specific certification for Cisco products.

After this boot camp, you may begin your certification journey with Security+. After earning that certification, you can take steps to further your credentials.  

- Your own interests can steer your certification path.
  
- For example, a penetration tester's certification path will be different from a computer forensics specialist's path.

    - A penetration tester's path might look like this: Security+ > CEH > CISSP > OSCP.

     - A forensic specialist's path might look like this: Security+ > CFCE > GCFA > EnCE.
       
       
Each domain has suggested guidance for the best certification path, as the CompTIA guide in the slide deck details.

  - We'll discuss performance-based questions in more detail later on.
- Test takers have 90 minutes to complete the exam.
- The passing score is 750, on a scale of 100-900.
- The cost of the exam is $392.00.   
  
#### Preparation Tips  

- Use CompTIA's study tools.
  - While there are many books, online resources, study guides, and apps available to prepare for the exam, CompTIA provides the most up-to-date resources for exam prep. 

  - From past students' experiences, the CompTIA CertMaster tool has proven to be the best method for preparing for the exam.

- Organize your study time.
  - Design a structured study plan and stick with it. Block out at least several weeks to focus on studying for the exam. 

  - If possible, find and meet with study groups to help encourage each other during test preparation.

- Focus on your weak spots.
  - Early on, attempt to determine which domains are the most challenging and focus your studies there.

- Use supplemental study tools. 
  - Create study guides and flashcards of common terms and acronyms. Find video content that explains confusing subjects.

  - For example, if you do not understand a term or a concept, search YouTube for a visual explanation of that topic.

- Find a Security+ online community.
  - There are many online blogs, forums (e.g., Reddit), and wiki pages dedicated to preparing for the Security+ exam.
  
#### Test-Taking Tips 

- Take care of yourself.
  - Arrive early, well-rested, fed, hydrated, and relaxed. 

- Pay attention.
  - Read each question and answer twice before deciding on your answer. 
  
  - Look for keywords in the questions, such as "best," "most," or "least."

  - Always stay aware of how much time remains. 

- If you're unsure of an answer, guess. 
  - Eliminate the answers you know are not correct, and select from the remaining answers. You'll receive the same penalty for an incorrect answer as for an unanswered question, so always make a best guess. 


### 10. Security+ CertMaster 

The best study tool for the Security+ is the **CertMaster Practice** tool from CompTIA.
  
Introduce the CertMaster Practice tool by covering the following:

### 13. Security+ PBQ  

The Security+ exam has two types of questions: multiple choice and **performance-based questions (PBQs)**. 
    
 - PBQs present test takers with a simulated environment, such as a network, firewall, or terminal. 

 - Since the question environment is simulated and not live, there may be some limitations compared to a real-world environment.

 - PBQs are often the first questions on the Security+ exam. 
  
In the next walkthrough, we'll explore some Security+ PBQ questions. 

#### PBQ Walkthrough

- Begin by accessing [CompTIA's PBQ simulation](https://simulation.comptia.org/), as the following image shows:
  
   ![A screenshot depicts the CompTIA PBQ simulation page.](Images/PBQ1.jpg)  
  
  - This is an interactive question in which you can click on page elements.
  
  - Experience the interactivity by selecting **Workstation 1**. It will open a Windows command prompt, as the following image shows:
  
   ![A screenshot depicts the Windows command prompt.](Images/PBQ2.jpg)    

- Scenarios and instructions are displayed on the left side of the screen, as the following image shows:
    
    ![A screenshot highlights the PBQ scenario and instructions.](Images/PBQ3.jpg)
 
  - Always read the scenario and instructions carefully.
  
   - **Scenario**: After experiencing attacks on its servers, Company A hired a cybersecurity analyst to configure a DMZ and increase security measures. Shortly after the network was reconfigured, an assistant on the second floor reported that one of the executives could not access the internet (more specifically https://comptia.org). However, he said, they can send internal email, use the intranet, and print on the local area network printer.  
    
  - **Instructions**:
      - Check the IP addresses and connectivity for each of the workstations to determine which is the affected machine. 
      - Use that information to ensure that the access control list (ACL) is properly configured to allow all workstations access to the internet.
      - The router's ACL implements an implicit deny. Only make changes to correct the connectivity issue.

Now, we'll complete the steps to solve the PBQ.
  
1. Check the IP addresses and connectivity for each of the workstations to determine which is the affected machine. 

   -  To check the IP address of each machine, run `ipconfig`.
      - Since `C:\` indicates that this is a Windows machine, we use `ipconfig` instead of `ifconfig`.
   - Check connectivity to the website https://comptia.org:
      - Run `ping comptia.org`

   - Run these commands for each workstation.

      - **Workstation 1**

       ![A screenshot depicts the commands for Workstation 1.](Images/PBQ4.jpg)

     - Workstation 1's IP address is `192.168.0.68`.
     
     - Workstation 1 received a successful ping response to comptia.org.
  
      - **Workstation 2**  

       ![A screenshot depicts the commands for Workstation 2.](Images/PBQ5.jpg)

       - Workstation 2's IP address is `192.168.0.82`.
       - Workstation 2 received a failed ping response to comptia.org.
  
   - So far, we have determined that Workstation 2, with the IP `192.168.0.82`, is the workstation that can't access the internet.

2. Use that information to ensure that the ACL is properly configured to allow all workstations access to the internet. 

    - Since we need to ensure that the access control list allows all workstations to access the internet, we will:
      - Select the router that connects the workstations to the internet.

      -  View the ACL of that router, as the following image shows:
  
       ![A screenshot depicts the ACL for that router.](Images/PBQ6.jpg)
  
     - This ACL contains the rules for what traffic is allowed in and out of the router.

     - To remove a rule, click the yellow **x** to the right of the rule, as the following image shows:
  
       ![A screenshot depicts the list of rules with a yellow X next to each.](Images/PBQ7.jpg)
    
   - Since Workstation 2 was the workstation experiencing a connectivity issue, we will first determine which subnet that workstation belongs to.

     - The only subnet `192.168.0.82` can belong to on the list is `192.168.0.80/28`.

     - `/28` means the IP range for this subnet is: `192.168.0.81` - `192.168.0.94`.

     - Explain that the rule setup for this subnet explains why the workstation can't access the internet. It is denying all access to any IP with any protocol and any port.

3. The router's ACL implements an implicit deny. Only make changes to correct the connectivity issue.

    - Remove this ACL rule to fix this connectivity issue by clicking the yellow **x**, as the following image shows:

       ![A screenshot highlights the yellow X next to the relevant rule.](Images/PBQ8.jpg)

    - After clicking the yellow **x**, the ACL rule is removed, as the following image shows:

      ![A screenshot depicts the list of rules with the relevant rule removed.](Images/PBQ9.jpg)

4. Finally, we need to submit our answers. 
  
   - Close the ACL page, and select **Submit** on the top right of the page, as the following image shows:

      ![A screenshot highlights the Submit button.](Images/PBQ10.jpg)

   - After selecting Submit, you will receive your score from this simulation, as the following image shows:

     ![A screenshot depicts the score earned for this PBQ.](Images/PBQ11.jpg)
