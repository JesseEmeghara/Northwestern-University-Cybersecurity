## Module 12 README: Web Development

### Module Description

In this module, you'll learn about web application architecture and the web client&ndash;server model HTTP communication process.

- On Day 1, we will cover the HTTP communication process in the web client&ndash;server model. We will then look at how sessions are managed by web applications using cookies.

- On Day 2, we will cover modern web application architecture and web application software "stacks" and how to deploy web application container sets and create SQL queries to manage data in databases.
