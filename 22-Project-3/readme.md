## Module 22 README: Project 3 - Building a Security Monitoring Environment

### Module Description

This week, students will use the skills that they have learned in the Defensive Security unit to design a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization. On **Day 1**, students will use Splunk to research and design a monitoring solution for their fictional organization. On **Day 2**, students will determine whether that monitoring solution will protect their organization from several simulated attacks. On **Day 3**, students will showcase their defensive projects with class presentations.


### Module Objectives

  <br>

- **Day 1:** Students will develop a defensive solution that uses a variety of the Splunk tools that they've learned in class to protect their mock organization. Students will be given logs of “normal” business functions to understand the organization's environment. They'll use these logs to create baselines, and then they'll design custom alerts, reports, and dashboards, which were covered in class. Additionally, students will download and use a Splunk "add-on" app of their choice to monitor against other types of attacks.

- **Day 2:** Students will experience a simulated attack against their hypothetical organization. Students will analyze the reports and dashboards that they created on Day 1 to determine whether their defensive choices protected their organization from these attacks. They'll be provided with review and analysis questions. Additionally, students will start preparing slides to present their findings on the third day of class.

- **Day 3:** Students will present in groups the defensive solutions that they created, how well or poorly they defended against the simulated attacks, and any adjustments they would make to their defensive solutions.

### Lab Environment

For the majority of demonstrations and activities, the class will use their web lab virtual machine.

### What to Be Aware Of:

- Students will work in the same groups throughout the whole project. Remind students to remember their groups as they will rejoin them each day this week.
- Be sure to plan ahead the presentation schedule for the third day of class. Emphasize to the class that they must only present within their allotted time.
