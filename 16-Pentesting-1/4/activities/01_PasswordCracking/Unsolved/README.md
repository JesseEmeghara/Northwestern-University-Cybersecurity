## Activity File: Password Cracking

- In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a pentester conducting an engagement on MegaCorpOne.
- In the previous activity, you successfully elevated your privileges to a privileged user.
- Now, you are tasked with re-performing enumeration as a high-privileged user to see what additional information you can gather, since you can now access more files.
- Specifically, you're tasked with cracking user hashes from the shadow file.

⚠️ **Reminder** - Don't forget to save your findings, as you will add them to your report on Day 4!


### Instructions 

1. SSH into the target machine using the credentials that you found during the privilege-escalation activity.

2. Gather a list of active users and their password hashes from the shadow file and save it as a `.txt` file.
     - Note that stealing the entire shadow file may be a waste of time, because Linux machines have service accounts that are disabled and will serve no use. Your goal in gathering password hashes is to eventually crack the hashes for the **users**, some of whom may have accounts with the same password on other machines on the network. 

3. Format your hashes as such: `username:passwordhash` (e.g., `bob:$1$HESu9xrH$k.o4G93DGoXaiQKkPmUgZ0`). 

     **Note**: The hash will start with `$1$` and end before the colon (`:`).

4. Crack the hashes by using `john` and passing in the text file with the hashes as an argument (e.g., `john hashes.txt`).

     **Note**: By default, `john` uses a default wordlist. Some passwords may need an additional wordlist. In Kali, wordlists are located in the `/usr/share/wordlists` directory. Try different wordlists until you crack the password for the 'tstark' user.
