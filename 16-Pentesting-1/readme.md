### Lab Environment

For this module, you will use the Pentesting lab environment located in Windows Azure Lab Services. RDP into the Windows RDP Host machine using the following credentials:

  - RDP login credentials for labs provisioned prior to 9/12/23
    - Username: `azadmin`
    - Password: `p4ssw0rd*`
  - RDP login credentials for labs provisioned after 9/12/23
    - Username: `azadmin`
    - Password: `p@ssw0rdp@ssw0rd`

The credentials to the Hyper-V VMs are as follows:

| Virtual Machine | Username | Password |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| Kali            |root|kali|
| Metasploitable2 |msfadmin|cybersecurity|
| Windows 10 |.\Administrator|Topsecret!|
| WINDC01 | Administrator|Topsecret!


### Module Checklist

- [x] Kali
- [x] Metasploitable 
- [x] WINDC01 (This will not be used during Pentesting 1)

### Security+ Domains

### Module Assignment 16

- There is no additional Challenge assignment for this module. At the end of Module 17, students will submit a report detailing their findings from their penetration testing activities against MegaCorpOne.  Students should make sure to keep records of all of their findings this week!


### Looking Forward 

Next week, we will continue exploring penetration testing but with a focus on penetration testing Windows operating systems.
