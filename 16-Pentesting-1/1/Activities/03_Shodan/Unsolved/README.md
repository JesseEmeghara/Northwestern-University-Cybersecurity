## Activity File: Shodan

- In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a pen tester conducting an engagement on MegaCorpOne.
- You are now tasked with performing OSINT by using Shodan.io.
- You will use Shodan.io to look at previously completed port scans on several targets, without the need to use Nmap to provide you additional insight into the target.
- Additionally, you will need to create a Shodan.io account to gather information on megacorpone.com. 


⚠️ **Reminder:** Don't forget to save your findings, as you will add them to your report on Day 4!

### Instructions

1. Navigate to https://account.shodan.io/register, and create a free account on Shodan.io. 

2. After registering, log in and navigate to https://shodan.io.

3. In a terminal session, perform an nslookup on www.megacorpone.com.

4. In Shodan, search the IP address that was returned from the nslookup query.

5. Answer the following questions: 

     - What ports are open?
	
     - What version of SSH is the server running?
	
     - What OS is the server?
	
     - What is the version of the web server running?
	
     - Which vulnerabilities may be present on the server? (CVE numbers are fine.)

     - Where is this server located?
