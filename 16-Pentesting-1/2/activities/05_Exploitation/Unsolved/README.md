## Activity File: Exploitation

- In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a pen tester conducting an engagement on MegaCorpOne.
- Using Nmap and Zenmap, you have discovered a machine on MegaCorpOne's internal network, Metasploitable2, that has a service which is known to have a vulnerability associated with it.
- You will now use a SearchSploit exploit to determine whether you can gain shell access on the host.

**Note:** Metasploitable2 is a purposefully vulnerable machine. You are not likely to discover this specific machine in a real environment.

⚠️ **Reminder:** Don't forget to save your findings, as you will add them to your report on Day 4!

### Instructions

1. Refer to your past Nmap or Zenmap scans, and look in the scan results for Metasploitable2. 
   - If you cannot find it by hostname, it will be the machine with the most ports open.

2. Several of these services are exploitable. However, one is exploitable with a Python script. Using `searchsploit` in Kali, search for any exploits around the service that is **listening on port 21**. You're searching for an exploit that allows you to execute a backdoor and is written in Python.
   - It's important to examine scripts before running them. Some scripts require variables to be edited within the script, whereas others can have variables passed through the command line. 

3. Edit the script in nano. The path that is listed on the right is relative to the `/usr/share/exploitdb/exploit` directory, e.g., `/usr/share/exploitdb/exploit/unix/remote/xxxxx.py`.

4. We can tell from the two variables `args` and `host` that this script accepts the IP address of the vulnerable host as an argument, so there is no need to edit the script. Close the script using ctrl+X.

5. Run the script without any arguments to see the output of the script. 

6. Now, pass in the host IP address as an argument, and run the script again. You should see a message saying "Success, shell opened." Type in a Linux command to check if the shell works.
