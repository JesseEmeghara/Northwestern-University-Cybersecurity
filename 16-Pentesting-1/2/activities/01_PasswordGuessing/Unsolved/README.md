## Activity File: Password Guessing

- In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a pen tester conducting an engagement on MegaCorpOne.
- One of MegaCorpOne's main concerns is that their password security is very poor and allows weak passwords.
- You are tasked with using the usernames that you found during the Day 1 OSINT phase to try and log in to vpn.megacorpone.com via password guessing.
- Once logged in, you will run a shell script that will log you in to the internal network.

⚠️ **Reminder:** Don't forget to save your findings, as you will add them to your report on Day 4!

:warning: **Heads Up:** This activity will require the Apache service running on Kali. If it is not running, start it with `service apache2 restart`.

### Instructions

1. On your Kali machine, open the web browser, navigate to vpn.megacorpone.com, where you will be prompted to log in.

2. Using the list of usernames that you obtained during Day 1 without the email extension (e.g., bsmith instead of bsmith@megacorpone.com), attempt to log in to the website by guessing basic passwords.
    - **Hint:** Try variants of "Password," "SeasonYear" (e.g., Summer2021), or even the user's own username. 
    - You only need to successfully guess **ONE** set of credentials to continue; the rest are bonus.

3. Once logged in, download the shell script in Kali and place it in your `Downloads` folder (if it doesn't automatically download to it). 

4. Change the permissions on the shell script to make it executable, then run the shell script and log in with the same credentials that you just used.

#### BONUS 

- Try guessing other users' passwords. 
   - **Hint:** There is a total of 5 username/password combinations that you can use to log in.
