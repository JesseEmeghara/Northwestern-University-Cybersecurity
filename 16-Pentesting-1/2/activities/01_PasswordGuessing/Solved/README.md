## Activity File: Password Guessing

In previous activities, you obtained a list of usernames pertaining to MegaCorpOne. Through OSINT, you discovered a website belonging to MegaCorpOne that asks for basic authentication. In this activity, you guessed a password that would allow you to log in to their web portal and download the file in the website.

:warning: **Heads Up:** This activity will require the Apache service running on Kali. If it is not running, start it with `service apache2 restart`.

### Instructions

1. On your Kali machine, open the web browser, navigate to vpn.megacorpone.com, where you will be prompted to log in.

2. Using the list of usernames that you obtained during Day 1 without the email extension (e.g., bsmith instead of bsmith@megacorpone.com), attempt to log in to the website by guessing basic passwords. 
    - **Hint:** Try variants of "Password," "SeasonYear" (e.g., Summer2021), or even the user's own username. 
    - You only need to successfully guess **ONE** set of credentials to continue; the rest are bonus.

	    - thudson\thudson
	    - trivera\Spring2021
	    - msmith\Passw0rd
	    - mcarlow\Pa55word
	    - agrofield\agrofield1
	
3. Once logged in, download the shell script in Kali and place it in your `Downloads` folder (if it doesn't automatically download to it). 

4. Change the permissions on the shell script to make it executable, then run the shell script and log in with the same credentials that you just used.

	- `chmod +x vpn.sh`

#### BONUS 

- Try guessing other users' passwords. 
   - **Hint:** There is a total of 5 username/password combinations that you can use to log in.
