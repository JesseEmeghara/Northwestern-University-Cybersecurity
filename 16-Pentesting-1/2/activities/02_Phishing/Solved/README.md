## Activity File: Phishing 

If we weren't so lucky in finding a VPN portal and VPN access file, we would have resorted to another means of initial access: phishing. In order to successfully trick an employee into either clicking on a malicious link or sending us their credentials, we need to create a phishing email that looks believable. In this activity, you will take an online phishing quiz to try to identify phishing emails.

### Instructions

1. In a web browser, navigate to https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/, and take the interactive test.
