## Activity File: Privilege Escalation


- In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a pentester conducting an engagement on MegaCorpOne.
- You now have a low-privileged shell as the daemon user on the remote host.  
- During a briefing meeting, MegaCorpOne explained that they were concerned that administrators were saving passwords in plain text on machines.
- You will need to determine if this has taken place.
- Additionally, you are now tasked with performing post-exploitation tasks in order to do proper enumeration which could lead to privilege escalation.

⚠️ **Reminder** - Don't forget to save your findings, as you will add them to your report on Day 4!

### Instructions

While operating through the reverse shell in Metasploit, use `grep` or `find` to search for any interesting files. 

**Hint 1**: Some keywords to search for include:
- admin
- key 
- password 
- secret

If you come across anything interesting that could be used for privilege escalation, perform the necessary actions in order to escalate your privileges from daemon to another user!

**Hint 2**: If you forget the syntax for `grep` or `find`, use the `man` tool or use Google!

**Bonus**: Once you are able to escalate your privileges to another user, see if you can escalate that user's privileges to root.
