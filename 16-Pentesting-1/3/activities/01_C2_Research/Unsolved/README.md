## Activity File: C2 Research

- In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a pentester conducting an engagement on MegaCorpOne.
- You are tasked with researching various C2 frameworks by using the [C2 Matrix website](https://www.thec2matrix.com/matrix) and suggesting the best C2 framework for your current assessment on MegaCorpOne.
- You will then answer several questions about the frameworks you select.

### Activity Instructions

Using the [C2 Matrix site](https://www.thec2matrix.com/matrix) and Google, find two C2 frameworks that fit the requirements described below.

**Requirements**

Throughout your initial scans on MegaCorpOne's domain, you've discovered several facts:
- Their network includes mostly Windows machines, with some Linux machines scattered throughout.
- Their firewall rules only allow ports 80, 443 TCP and port 53 UDP outbound. 

The service contract includes a few additional requirements:
- The C2 framework must support logging.
- The framework must have a full version released&mdash;i.e., the version must be 1.0 or higher. No "beta" or "PoC" versions allowed.
- You will bring on coworkers to help with this assessment, so the framework needs to support multiple users. 

**Note**: It's okay if your primary C2 framework does not support all operating systems, as long as the secondary or tertiary framework supports the systems that the primary framework does not.

### Questions

For each framework that you've identified as a good candidate, answer the following questions:

1. What is the name of the C2 framework?
2. What operating systems do its agents support?
3. What channels can the agents communicate over?
4. What language is it written in?
5. Is it open or closed source?
6. Does the developer have a Slack or Twitter link for potential support questions?
