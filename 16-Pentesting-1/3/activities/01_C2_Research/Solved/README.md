## Activity File: C2 Research

Offensive security professionals use command and control units in order to remotely control the payloads they have deployed on target computers. In this activity, you researched various C2 frameworks using the [C2 Matrix site](https://www.thec2matrix.com/matrix) and suggested a C2 framework for your current assessment.

Throughout your initial scans on MegaCorpOne's domain, you've discovered several facts:

- Their network includes mostly Windows machines, with some Linux machines scattered throughout.

- Their firewall rules only allow ports 80, 443 TCP and port 53 UDP outbound.

The service contract includes a few additional requirements:

- The C2 framework must support logging.

- The framework must have a full version released&mdash;i.e., the version must be 1.0 or higher. No "beta" or "PoC" versions allowed.

- You will bring on coworkers to help with this assessment, so the framework needs to support multiple users. 

**Note**: It's okay if your primary C2 framework does not support all operating systems, as long as the secondary or tertiary framework supports the systems that the primary framework does not.

### Instructions 

Using the [C2 Matrix site](https://www.thec2matrix.com/matrix) and Google, find two C2 frameworks that fit your operational needs. 

For each framework that you've identified as a good candidate, answer the following questions:

1. What is the name of the C2 framework?

    - Cobalt Strike 
    
2. What operating systems do its agents support?

    - Windows

3. What channels can the agents communicate over?

    - HTTP/S, DNS, TCP, SMB

4. What language is it written in?

    - Java

5. Is it open or closed source?

    - Closed

6. Does the developer have a Slack or Twitter link for potential support questions?

    - No
