## Activity File: Metasploit Exploitation

Through our previous Nmap scan, we discovered several services that are exploitable. MegaCorpOne has given you permission to exploit any vulnerable service you find as long as you document your actions. 

The following image shows the results of the Nmap scan that you ran in a previous activity:

- :warning: **Heads Up**: Metasploit sometimes will choose a different default network adapter, which will cause exploits to not fully establish a connection back to Kali. If you encounter this, set the default LHOST via `setg LHOST 172.22.117.100`

### Instructions

Your task was to use Metasploit to exploit as many services as you could within the time limit, and then document your actions using the following format:

- **Exploit**:
- **Host IP address**:
- **Port**:
- **Service name**:
- **Service version**:
- **Exploit outcome**:

For example:

- **Exploit**: https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor/
- **Host IP address**: 172.22.117.150
- **Port**: 21
- **Service name**: FTP
- **Service version**: VSFTPD 2.3.4
- **Exploit outcome**: Success

For attribution purposes, it's **extremely** important to document **every** exploit attempt, even if it fails. You may attempt exploitation as many times as you'd like.
