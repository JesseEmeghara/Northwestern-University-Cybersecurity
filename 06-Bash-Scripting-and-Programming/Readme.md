## Module 6 README: Bash Scripting and Programming

### Module Description

In the final module of our introduction to Linux system administration, we'll learn how to combine commands, create custom commands, and write bash scripts.

- We'll use these skills to collect logs, audit and reconfigure a Linux machine, and take steps to harden the system. 

- In Day 3, we will participate in a Linux Scavenger Hunt. This extended activity will put to use all the skills and tools covered in the past three modules.

### Lab Environment

In Days 1 and 2, we will use our web lab virtual machine.

- Student lab access credentials: 

    - Username: `sysadmin`
    - Password: `cybersecurity`

In Day 3, we will continue to use the web lab, except will be accessing a new machine for the scavnger hunt.


### What to Be Aware 0f

- On Day 3, after the scavenger hunt activity, we will set up our Azure Lab accounts to prepare for the Windows environment needed in upcoming modules. 

- You will receive class-specific registration links with unique student credentials.

### Module 6: Challenge Assignment

This module's Challenge assignment can be found in Canvas.
- In this week's Challenge assignment, students will play the role of a criminal hacker. They will remotely access a victim's target machine, maintain access using a backdoor, and crack sensitive passwords in the /etc directory.

### Looking Forward 

- In the next module, we'll apply some of the concepts and best practices learned in these Linux system administration modules to to a new operating system: Windows. In the Windows System Administration and Hardening module, we will use the Windows command line and PowerShell to perform system administration tasks and write scripts in Windows 10. We will also learn how to to manage and use Active Directory Domain Services.

We will be using the Microsoft Azure Labs for the first time. Make sure you have a working installation of Windows Azure before the start of next week. If you have any questions, consult your instruction staff and refer to this document:
