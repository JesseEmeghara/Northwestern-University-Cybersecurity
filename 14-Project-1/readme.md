### Lab Environment

For the majority of demonstrations and activities, the class will use Microsoft Azure cloud services and the Azure cloud portal.

- You will **not** use any of the Azure lab environments. Instead, you will use personal Azure accounts.

### What to Be Aware of:

   - Students can choose to work independently or work in groups, but students are **required** to remain in class (online or in person).

   - Each day builds on the previous day to complete the project, and each day's activities must be completed **in order**.

   - Students will have **two** choices for their website's domain. The choices are based on the cost they are willing to spend.

     - Based on the student choice, they will follow specific project instructions in each project day.

   - If students purchase a domain, they can elect to cancel their domain for a full refund if they cancel their domain within 5 days of ordering.
