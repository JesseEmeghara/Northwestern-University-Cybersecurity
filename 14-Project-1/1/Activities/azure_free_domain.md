#### !!Important!! - Backing up your HTML

- Restarting your virtual machine will often clear out any updates to your HTML files. Therefore, it is important to back them up every time you make an update!

- After each update to your webpage, make sure you back up your index.html file to your /home directory (which stays persistent across reboots) with the following command:

  - `cp /var/www/html/index.html /home` 

- In case you need to restore your `index.html` file, run the following command:

  - `cp /home/index.html /var/www/html/ `

After you have saved and backed up your changes, return to your browser and refresh your webpage.

  - Congratulations, you now have your own cloud-hosted web blog!
