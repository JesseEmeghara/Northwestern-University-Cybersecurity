## Module 3 README: Terminal and Bash

### Module Description

In this module, we will gain technical hands-on experience by using bash and the command line. Learning the command line can be a challenging adjustment, but it is an absolutely vital skill for IT and Cybersecurity professionals. 

- We will begin with basic file navigation and retrieval. Then, we'll expand into file searching, combining commands, and adding command options. Then we will use text processing and text editing to develop a custom command-line script.

- **Day 1:** How Sweet is the Terminal?

   - Discuss the prominence and utility of the command line in IT and security professions.

   - Use commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `rmdir`, and `cat` for basic file navigation and manipulation.

   - Navigate deeply nested folder structures using relative and absolute file paths.

   - Use commands like `head`, `tail`, `more`, and `less` to preview files in the command line.

   - Combine the above commands in sequence to accomplish relevant IT tasks.

- **Day 2:** Commanding the Command Line

    - Identify and explain the structure of a terminal command.

    - Explain how options modify the default behavior of a terminal command.

    - Use the `man` command to list instructions and options for each command.

    - Use the `find` command to locate files based on search parameters.

    - Use the `grep` command to search within the contents of files.  

    - Use the `wc` command to count words and lines.

    - Combine multiple commands in sequence with pipes to accomplish intermediate IT tasks.  

- **Day 3:** Stick to the Script

    - Define three benefits of text processing programs over programming languages for a security professional.

    - Use `sed` to make substitutions to a file.

    - Use `awk` to isolate  data points from a complex log file.

    - Edit contents of a file using `nano`.

    - Design an IP lookup shell script by passing arguments.

### Lab Environment

You will use your web lab machine for today's activities.

- After logging into the web lab, student credentials to access the ubuntu VM:
    - Username:`student`
    - Password: `cybersecurity`

### What to Be Aware Of:

- Practice makes perfect! This is the first technical, hands-on module of the course and it can take some hard work to adjust to. Take the time you need to practice getting used to working on the command line.

### Module 3: Challenge Assignment

This module's Challenge assignment can be found in Canvas.
-  For this week's Challenge assignment, students will use their new command-line skills to uncover the identities of a rogue casino player and dealer colluding to scam a casino out of thousands of dollars.

### Looking Forward 

Next week, we will start thinking like system administrators. We will learn about the Linux operating system and build off the commands and skills we learn in Module 3 in order to investigate and troubleshoot a malfunctioning server.
