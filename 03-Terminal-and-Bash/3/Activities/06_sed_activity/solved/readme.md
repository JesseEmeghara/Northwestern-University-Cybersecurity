## Solution Guide: Using sed 

- The first step is to navigate into the `learning_sed` directory. To do this, run the following commands:
 
  - `cd /03-student/day3/`

  - `cd learning_sed`
       
- View the two admin log files inside by running `ls`. This will display:  

    ```
    Admin_logA.txt 
    Admin_logB.txt 
    ```

- Next we will combine the two files into a file called `Combined_Access_logs.txt` with the following command:

  - `cat Admin_logA.txt Admin_logB.txt > Combined_Access_logs.txt`

- We will preview the file by using the `cat` command to see the different failed login descriptions, which are titled `ACCESS_DENIED` and `INCORRECT_PASSWORD`:

   - `cat Combined_Access_logs.txt`
           
- Next we will write a `sed` command to replace `INCORRECT_PASSWORD` with `ACCESS_DENIED` and move the data into a new file called `Update1_Combined_Access_logs.txt/`. To do so, run the following command:

  - `sed s/INCORRECT_PASSWORD/ACCESS_DENIED/ Combined_Access_logs.txt > Update1_Combined_Access_logs.txt`
