## Activity File: Warm-Up

- You continue to be a security analyst at Wonka Corp.

- Thanks to your great work, the authorities were able to charge Slugworth Corp.

- The prosecutor on the case has subpoenaed you for a list of additional data to help build the case against Slugworth.

- You are tasked with gathering additional information specified in the subpoena.

### Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from within the `/03-student/day3/warmup` folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:

 1.  Create a folder called `subpoena_request`. 

2.  As specified in the subpoena, gather the following and place them in the `subpoena_request` folder:

    - Files from the `WEBACCESS` directory, dated 0719.
    
    - Employee mobile phone logs from the `PHONE_LOGS` directory, which provide proof of calls made to Slugworth's number:  454-555-3894.

      - Place these specific call logs in a new file called `Calls_to_Slugworth.`

#### Bonus

  - Find the employee phone directory. Use a single `grep` command to determine if any other employees besides Ruth and Henry were contacting Slugworth.
