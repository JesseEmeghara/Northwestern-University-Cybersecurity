## Activity File: Using awk   
  
- You continue in your role as security analyst at Wonka Corp.

  1. Move `Update1_Combined_Access_logs.txt` into the directory `/03-student/day3/learning_awk`.

     - If you didn't have a chance to finish the last activity feel free to use the `Update1_Combined_Access_logs.txt` file located [here](Update1_Combined_Access_logs.txt). 

  1. Use the `awk` command to isolate the time and username fields out from this file.
