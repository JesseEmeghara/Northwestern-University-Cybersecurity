## Activity File: Building an IP Lookup Tool  
  
- You continue in your role as security analyst at Wonka Corp.

- Wonka has been experiencing more attacks on its network.

- Your manager wants to know what country these attacks are coming from so Wonka Corp can block the country from accessing its network.

- Specifically, they would like you to design a script that can look up the countries of several IP addresses pulled from the logs.

### Instructions

Using only the command line, change into the `/03-student/day3/IP_Lookup_Tool` directory. From there, complete the following tasks:
  
1. You have been provided a new command to look up details for an IP address:

     - To look up information on the IP of `104.223.95.86`, you would run:  

        `curl -s http://ipinfo.io/104.223.95.86`

       - **Hint:** Read the man page of the `curl` command to learn more about what it can do.

   Using  pipes, `grep`, and `awk`, modify the `curl` command to display only the country.

      - **Hints:**

         - Use `grep` to display only the line that contains the country. 

         - Use `awk` to parse out the country from that line.

  2.  Place the command into a new shell script called `IP_lookup.sh`.

  3.  Modify the script so the IP address is an argument that can be passed into the script.

  4. The following IP addresses were found in Wonka's log files. Run your new  `IP_lookup.sh` with these IP addresses as arguments to determine their countries:

       - IP 1: `133.18.55.255`

       - IP 2: `41.34.55.255`

       - IP 3: `187.54.23.8`
