## Solution Guide: Building an IP Lookup Tool

- The first step is to create and navigate into the `/03-student/day3/IP_Lookup_Tool` folder on your virtual machine. To do this, run the following command:
 
  - `cd /03-student/day3/IP_Lookup_Tool`
       
- Begin with running the new command to see what data it returns on an IP address:

  - `curl -s http://ipinfo.io/104.223.95.86`
       
   - This returns:
  
   ```{
    "ip": "104.223.95.86",
    "hostname": "r-86-95-223-104.consumer-pool.prcdn.net",
    "city": "Atlanta",
    "region": "Georgia",
    "country": "US",
    "loc": "33.7490,-84.3880",
    "org": "AS8100 QuadraNet Enterprises LLC",
    "postal": "30302",
    "timezone": "America/New_York",
    "readme": "https://ipinfo.io/missingauth"
    ```

- Next, we are tasked with using `grep`, pipes, and `awk` to extract only the country from these results.

- To do this, we will first modify the script to `grep` the line that has the country:

   - `curl -s http://ipinfo.io/104.223.95.86 | grep country`

- When you run this command, it will return the following:

  ```
   "country": "US", 
   ```
    
- We need to now use `awk` to isolate out the value of `"US"` from this line.

- To do this, we will filter by `:` as this is what separates the title of `"country"` and the value:

  - `curl -s http://ipinfo.io/104.223.95.86 | grep country | awk -F: '{print $2}'`
    
  - We also print out the second value since that field contains the country.

- The above command returns the following:

   ```
    "US",
   ```

- Next we will place this script into a file called `IP_lookup.sh`:

   - `nano IP_lookup.sh`
     
    - We will place the command within this script.

-  We need to make the IP address an argument that is passed, so we will replace the IP with `$1`.

   - `curl -s http://ipinfo.io/$1 | grep country | awk -F: '{print $2}'`
        
- Save the Nano file by pressing Ctrl+x together, and y to keep the name as `IP_lookup.sh`.

- Run the following three commands to confirm the script can identify the country from the IP addresses:

   - `sh IP_lookup.sh  133.18.55.255`

   - `sh IP_lookup.sh  41.34.55.255`

   - `sh IP_lookup.sh  187.54.23.8`
     
- The results should show:

  ```
  - "JP",
  - "EG",
  - "BR",

- You can then check `http://www.ip2country.net/ip2country/country_code.html` to confirm which countries are represented by these codes
  ```

- We can clean this up a little by getting rid of the extraneous quotes and comma. We do this by telling awk to use a class of characters as field separators, changing the command in our script from `awk -F: '{print $2}'` to `awk -F'[:",]' '{print $2}'`
