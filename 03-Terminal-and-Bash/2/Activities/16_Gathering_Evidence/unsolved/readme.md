## Activity File: Gathering Evidence
 
- In this activity, you will continue your role as a security analyst at Wonka Corp. 

- Wonka Corp believes they have enough evidence to send to the authorities to have Slugworth Corp charged with a cyber crime. 

- Your task is to gather several points of evidence from your file systems that can be provided to the authorities to prove Slugworth is stealing data.

### Instructions

Using only the command line, continue to complete the following tasks in the `/03-student/day2/Gathering_Evidence` folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:

1.  In the `Gathering_Evidence` folder, make a directory called `Slugworth_evidence`.

2. The `email` directory contains an archive of emails from the employees.

 Place into a  new file called `slugworth_email_evidence` the following data:

    - List of emails referencing Slugworth.

    - Number of emails referencing Slugworth.
  
    **Hint:** Use the pipe and redirection command to append the additional data to this file.
    
 3. The `web_logs` directory contains an archive of web log access by date for PeanutButtery.net. The IP of Slugworth, which is a numerical number that identifies an address on the network, is `13.16.23.234`.

    - Place into a new file called `slugworth_web_evidence` the following data:
    
      - Which web log file contains the IP address of Slugworth.

      - The number of times Slugworth's IP is found in this file.
    
4. Move the two new evidence files into the directory `Slugworth_evidence`.
   
5.  Combine them both into a single file called `Slugworth_evidence_for_authorities`.
