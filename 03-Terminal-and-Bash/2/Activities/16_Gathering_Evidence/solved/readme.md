## Solution Guide: Gathering Evidence

- The first step is to navigate into the `/03-student/day2/Gathering_Evidence/` folder on your VM. To do this, run the following command:

   - `cd /03-student/day2/Gathering_Evidence/`
       
- In the `Gathering_Evidence` Folder, make a directory called `Slugworth_evidence` by running:   

  - `mkdir Slugworth_evidence`
         
- Next, move into the email directory:

  - `cd email`
      
- List the emails referencing Slugworth, and place the results in a file called `Slugworth_email_evidence`: 
        
  - `grep -il slugworth * > slugworth_email_evidence`
         
  
- Next, add to the same file the number of emails that contain Slugworth:
    

      grep -il slugworth * | wc -l >> slugworth_email_evidence



- The next step is to place into a  new file called `slugworth_web_evidence` the following data:
    - Which web log file contains Slugworth's IP address.
    - The number of Slugworth IPs addresses found in this file. 
    
 - Access the `web_logs` directory by going back a directory (`cd ..`), then:

   - `cd web_logs`

- To find the log files that have the IP address of `13.16.23.234` and place them in a new file called `slugworth_web_evidence`, run:

   - `grep -il 13.16.23.234 * > slugworth_web_evidence`
 
- Next, to append to this file the number of records that contain the IP address, run:
   
  - `grep -i 13.16.23.234 * | wc -l >> slugworth_web_evidence`
    
- Now we will move both of the evidence files over to the `Slugworth_evidence` directory that we created:

   - `cd ../../`
   - ` mv ./Gathering_Evidence/email/slugworth_email_evidence ./Gathering_Evidence/Slugworth_evidence/`
   - `mv ./Gathering_Evidence/web_logs/slugworth_web_evidence ./Gathering_Evidence/Slugworth_evidence/`  
         
- Next, navigate to the `Slugworth_evidence` directory, and concatenate the files into a single file called `Slugworth_evidence_for_authorities`:

  - `cd Gathering_Evidence/Slugworth_evidence/`  
  - `cat slugworth_email_evidence slugworth_web_evidence > Slugworth_evidence_for_authorities`
  
- The last step is to confirm the file has the correct data for the authorities. Run: 

  - `cat Slugworth_evidence_for_authorities`

 - The results should be:
      ```
      email5 
      email7  
      email8  
      3
      0518weblog 
      22
      ```
     While this file contains all the data the authorities need, this is not obvious. In tomorrow's lesson we'll learn how to edit the contents of a file to further describe the evidence.
