## Activity File: grep  
 
- You will continue your role as a security analyst at Wonka Corp.

- Your manager now needs to know which of the secret recipes include guavaberries. 

  - Even if Slugworth Corp was able to obtain the secret recipe, they won't be able to produce the candy since Wonka is the sole owner of the guavaberry plant.

- Your task is to determine which of the secret recipes contain guavaberries in the list of ingredients.

### Instructions

 Using only the command line, continue to complete the following tasks in the `/03-student/day2/finding_your_way/` folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:

1. Navigate back into the `PeanutButtery.net` directory that contained the secret recipes. 

2. Find all recipes that include the word "guavaberries" in their list of ingredients.
    
#### Bonus

Your manager realized that some of the recipes require guavaberries as **optional**, and is now concerned Slugworth Corp can still make these secret recipes.

- Compose a single command to find all the files that have the word "guavaberries" OR "optional" in the recipe.
