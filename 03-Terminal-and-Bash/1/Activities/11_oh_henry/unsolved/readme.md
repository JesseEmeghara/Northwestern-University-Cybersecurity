##  Activity File: Oh Henry, What Did You Do?
 
- You continue in your role as a security analyst at Wonka Corp, investigating the employees potentially selling secret recipes to Slugworth Corp.

- Your manager at Wonka Corp has identified two possible insiders who may be working with Slugworth Corp: Henry and Ruth.

- Your manager has quickly pulled some files from Henry and Ruth's computers without their knowledge.

- Some of the files contain gibberish, but some may have useful data.

- Your manager has asked you to preview the files to see if they have readable text data that can be analyzed later.

### Instructions

Using only the command line, complete the following tasks from the `/03-student/day1/oh_henry/` folder in your Ubuntu virtual machine:

  1. There are two folders inside the `/03-student/day1/oh_henry/` folder. One for files captured from Henry, and one for files captured from Ruth.

     * Use the preview commands to determine which of the files contain readable text data.

  3. Remove the files that contain non-readable text data.
    
#### Bonus

  The files each have a timestamp at the bottom.

 * Use the `mv` command to rename each file by adding the date found on the bottom of the file.
 
   - For example: `File1` has a date of October 11, 2019. Rename it to `file1-10_11_2019`.
