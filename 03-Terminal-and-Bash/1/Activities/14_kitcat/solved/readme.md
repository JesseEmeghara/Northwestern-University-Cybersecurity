## Solution Guide: Internal Investigation: Finding the Kit Cat Burglar

- First, navigate into the `/03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar` folder on your VM. To do this, run the following commands:

  - `cd /03-student/day1/`

  - `cd find_kit_cat_burglar`

-  This directory has folders for evidence gathered from Henry and Ruth.

- Within Henry and Ruth's directories are sub-directories for:

     - Emails;

     - Files;

     - Logs; and

     - Other.

- To preview all the files in each of these directories and find those that can be used as evidence, you can use `more`, `less`, or `head`.

  - The files that contain "evidence" to provide to the authorities are: 

    * `/03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/ruth/emails/emailA`

    * `/03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/ruth/files/sd.txt`

    * `/03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/emails/email1`

    * `/03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/emails/email4`

    * `/03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/logs/log1`

    * `/03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/logs/log2`

    * `/03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/other/top_secret/recipe_for_sugarplum`

    * `/03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/other/top_secret/recipe_for_sweetums`     
   
- Next, go back to  the `find_kit_cat_burglar` directory, and make a directory called `Evidence_for_authorities`. Run the following command:

  - `mkdir Evidence_for_authorities`

- Copy all the evidence files found into this directory. To do this, run the following commands using absolute paths:
            
       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/ruth/emails/emailA   /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities

       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/ruth/files/sd.txt     /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities

       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/emails/email1  /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities

       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/emails/email4   /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities

       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/logs/log1    /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities

       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/logs/log2  /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities

       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/other/top_secret/recipe_for_sugarplum    /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities

       cp /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/henry/other/top_secret/recipe_for_sweetums  /03-student/day1/find_kit_cat_burglar/Evidence_for_authorities
    
-  The last step is to concatenate all the files together. Move into `Evidence_for_authorities` and run:

   - `cat  emailA sd.txt  email1 email4 log1 log2     recipe_for_sugarplum  recipe_for_sweetums > Wonka-evidence.txt` 

 **Bonus**
 
 - The hidden files are `lp.txt`, `dj.txt`, `bb.txt`, and `b7.txt` in Ruth's `files` directory.

 - To change the file extension from .txt to .jpg, run:

   - `mv lp.txt  lp.jpg`

   - `mv dj.txt  dj.jpg`

   - `mv bb.txt  bb.jpg`

   - `mv b7.txt  b7.jpg`
   
 - Open the file to display the images.
