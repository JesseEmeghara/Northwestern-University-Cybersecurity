## Solution Guide: Finding Your Milky Way

- First, navigate into the `students` folder on your VM using an absolute path. To do so, run the following command:

  - `cd /03-student/day1/take_5`

- Create an additional folder called `Internal_Investigation_Employee_B`:

   - `mkdir Internal_Investigation_Employee_B`
    
-  To confirm the folder was created, run:
      - `ls`
          
- Move the file `email_evidence` from `Internal_Investigation_Employee_A` to `Internal_Investigation_Employee_B` using absolute paths:

  - `mv /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A/email_evidence /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B/`

- Copy the file `log_evidence` from `Internal_Investigation_Employee_A` to `Internal_Investigation_Employee_B`:

  - `cp /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A/log_evidence /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B/`
    
- Navigate to the directories to confirm the files have been copied and moved correctly.

  - To check the `Employee_A` directory, run: 

    - `cd /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_A/`

    -  `ls`
        
    Since we moved the `email_evidence` file, the only file that should remain is `log_evidence`. 
           
  - To check the `Employee_B` directory, run: 

      - `cd /03-student/day1/take_5/Internal_Investigation_Employee_B/`
      
      - `ls`

    The existing files should be `log_evidence` and `email_evidence`.
