## Activity File: Exploiting `tar`

In this exercise, you'll play the part of a penetration tester hunting for vulnerabilities in a target system's backup procedures.

- You'll use the `wildpwn.py` tool to verify that the system's current configuration is indeed vulnerable to this kind of privilege escalation attack.

- Then, you'll research and suggest two mitigation strategies to protect the server in the future.

### Instructions

1. Using the following credentials, log in as `jane` and use `sudo -l` to verify that you have no `sudo` rights:

    - Username: `jane`

    - password: `password`

2. Next, we'll look for automated `tar` backup files that can be exploited. 

    -  As `jane`, navigate to your `~/Documents` directory in the terminal. Are there any archive files present?

        - What might the name of the file indicate? Use `ls -lat` to check the ownership of the archive. Why wouldn't this file belong to `jane`?

        - Delete the archive file. You'll now need to wait a minute or two to test to see if the archive file comes back. If the archive file comes back, this means it can be potentially exploited with a `wildcard attack`.

    - Now that we've confirmed there is a regenerating archive file that is potentially backing up the contents of `jane`'s `Document` directory, we'll continue with the following steps: 

        - Downloading the `wildpwn` exploit tool. 

        - Running it to create payloads.

        - Waiting for the automated `tar` backup system task also archive the malicious payload files, thus activating our exploit. 

    - Note that there is a subdirectory, `ExploitTar`, that has been created for your pen-testing tasks. Use this folder to run `wildpwn` in.

3. Download the [wildpwn.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/localh0t/wildpwn/master/wildpwn.py) attack tool to your `~/Documents/ExploitTar` directory. Do this from the command line, not the browser.

     - **Hint**: Use `wget` or `curl`.

    - Navigate to and check the contents of this directory before we execute the python script.

4. Use `wildpwn.py` to generate the malicious `tar` payload files within the `/home/jane/Documents/ExploitTar` directory, which is expected to be frequently backed up.

   - Remember: the exploit becomes staged when the system's automated backup task archives Jane's documents into the `tar` file that we found earlier.

   - If you are unsure how to use this file: after downloading the script, run `python wildpwn.py -h` to look up usage. If you are stuck, ask your instructor or TA for the proper command.

   - Run `ls` to check the directory for our newly created files. 

   - As the regular user `jane`, you just planted malicious files that will create the exploit file when they are automatically backed up by the system.

5. Now we wait. 

    - After waiting a minute or two, re-run the `ls` command but with the proper options to see the new hidden subdirectory. 
    
    - Navigate into that subdirectory and list its hidden file. This is the one you'll want to run to execute the `wildcard attack` exploit.

6. Time to run the exploit.  

    - While still in the hidden subdirectory, execute the hidden file within the terminal.

    - What happened to your command prompt that confirms this exploit worked?


7. As `root`, make `jane` a superuser with `sudo` access.  

    - Add `jane` to `/etc/sudoers` by running `visudo`. This will allow our user `jane` to run commands with superuser privileges. Also, specify the `NOPASSWD` rule for this user.

    - If you're not sure how to do this, there is a similar user set up under `root`'s **specifications**.

8. Let's test the our new privileges and then cover our tracks. 

    - Log back in as `jane` and verify that you can run commands with `sudo`. 
    
    - Then, remove the entire `ExploitTar` directory to cover your tracks.

9. Congratulations! You have successfully executed what is known as a `tar wildcard attack`! This is a more discreet attack that can be carried out on a Unix-based operating system with `tar` installed. 

    - After verifying that you can  escalate privileges and modify the system to catastrophic effect, identify two ways to prevent this attack in the future.
