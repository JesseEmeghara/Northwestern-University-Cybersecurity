## 4.2 Student Guide: Linux Access Controls

### Class Overview

In today's class, we will continue our introduction to Linux by covering one of the operating system's most important functions: access control. You will complete a sequence of tasks that will expose you to many of the most fundamental aspects of Linux security: password strength, careful control of the `sudo` command, and file permissions.

The skills and tools covered today will be essential for various professional roles, from systems administration to penetration testing.

### Class Objectives

By the end of class today, you will be able to:

- Audit passwords using `john`.

- Elevate privileges with `sudo` and `su`.

- Create and manage users and groups.

- Inspect and set file permissions for sensitive files on the system.

### Lab Environment

You will use your web lab virtual machine for today's activities. 

- Student access:

  - Username: `sysadmin`

  - Password: `cybersecurity`

### 01. Welcome and Review

In the previous class, we covered: 

- History and distributions of Linux.

- Navigating the Linux file structure using the command line.

- Managing processes with commands like `top`, `ps`, and `kill`.

- Installing packages using `apt`.

Today's class is focused on Linux's access control functions: passwords, file permissions, groups, and `sudo` access.

Access control refers to regulating what actions users and programs are and are not allowed to take on a system.

Today will focus on users and the last day of the module will focus on programs.

Today's class will build on Day 1 topics by covering:

- Passwords and password cracking.

- Switching between users with `su`.

- Elevating privileges with `sudo`.

- File permissions and access controls.

- Managing users and groups.

 ### 02. Users and Passwords

Your activities throughout the week involve auditing a malfunctioning server. Note the following:

- In the previous class, we viewed some important files, stopped a malicious process, and installed tools to facilitate the audit.

- Today, we will look at user access, starting with user passwords.

- In the previous class, we viewed the `/etc/shadow` file. This file contains hashes of every user's password on the system.

- The passwords are obfuscated with a hashing function, which means they are not stored in plain text.

#### A Brief Introduction to Hashes and Password Cracking

We have a whole module later in the program dedicated to cryptography, where we will cover hashing in depth. For now we will only cover a few basics. Note the following about hashes:

- A hash is a cryptographic function that takes data as input and translates it to a string of different, random-looking data.

- A hash will always output the same string for the same input data. So, when a password is entered into the system, the system hashes it the same way each time.

    - The same password will always produce the exact same hash.

- This hash is stored in the `shadow` file. When a user logs back in with the same password, the hash of the password they entered is compared with the hash stored for that user in the `/etc/shadow` file. If it matches, the user is logged in. If the hash doesn't match, the user is not logged in.

Note the following about password-cracking tools:

- Password-cracking tools do not reverse a password hash, but instead take a list of words and characters, and create a hash for each one.

- Each hash is then compared to the hash it is trying to crack. If the two hashes match, the password has been found.

- This form of password cracking is an example of a **brute force attack**.

- This is why the best passwords are long, with lots of random characters. The more random the password and the more characters it has, the longer it will take a cracking program to find a hash that matches it.

What makes a stronger password, it's complexity or it's length?

- Length and complexity work together to make a password strong.

- However, when it comes to brute force attacks, password length has more impact on the time it takes to crack it.

What is the current "industry standard" length for a password?

  - Currently, the industry standard for password length is eight characters.

  - We will soon find out that eight is only a minimum. It can still be cracked, though it takes some patience.

Navigate to [https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/](https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/).

To see the importance of length, repeat the same character in one long string.

- Enter `jjjjjjjj` (eight j's). Eight characters crack instantly.

- Enter `jjjjjjjjjjjj` (twelve j's). Twelve characters will take four weeks to crack.

- Enter `jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj` (sixteen j's). This password takes 35 thousand years to crack.

- Enter `b4Ei@2!` (seven random characters). This password only takes seven minutes to crack.

- Enter `Jng0i$7w` (eight random characters). This password takes nine hours to crack.

- Enter `534Yc8@CmF` (ten random characters). This password takes 6 years to crack.

- Enter `*%uDiH2^T2n4` (twelve random characters). This password takes 34 thousand years to crack.

Takeaways:

- If a system requires sixteen characters and nothing else, the password will remain relatively strong, even if it includes words.

- Add a few extra characters and it gets exponentially more secure.

- In contrast, if you use all random characters, you still have to make the password at least 10 characters long for it to be very effective.

#### Cracking Passwords

- We just saw how and why passwords are hashed and stored.

- Modern password cracking software works using the following steps:

  - Takes a list of hashes as input.

  - Starts by hashing passwords from a given password list and comparing each hash to the list of hashes it was given. 

  - If it matches a hash, it gives outputs of what password was used to create the hash.

  This password cracking is a type of brute force attack because it will ultimately try _all_ possible passwords, and eventually manage to reverse the hash.

- **John the Ripper** is a popular modern software because it can crack a wide variety of hashes. 

#### Using John the Ripper

- The two steps needed to run John the Ripper are:

  - **Step 1:** Create a hashlist, which is a file that contains the hashes you are trying to crack.

  - **Step 2:** Run John the Ripper to crack the hashes.

Step 1: Creating the Hashlist

- **John The Ripper** can take an input file that contains usernames and password hashes. 

  - John the Ripper requires input files to use a specific format. 

  - Each line must look like: `username:hash`. A list of usernames and password hashes is often called a **hashlist**. In practice, it looks like:

  ```bash
  admin:e08e4506d2e3f370a5e8ab79647df309
  guest:a132mj06d2e3f370a5e8ab79647df309
  ```
  
- You can also simply grab one whole record from the `/etc/shadow` file to add to the hashlist.

  - For example:
  
    ``sally:$6$c0QGG1OFuiDGNKZT$wzbxLSWFOSyeSiyNZc2wNjaKr1B/w.D1xp7QBU0wG6xbBUbdZKEb1HwmW2Zn92/9jbVd.slXMByeLJeh1btOD.:18387:0:99999:7:::``

  - John the Ripper knows how to grab the hash from a `shadow` file record.
    
Step 2: Running John the Ripper

- You run John the Ripper with the following simple format:
 
    - `john <hashlist>`

      - For example:  `john hashlist.txt`
      
- You can also have John the Ripper run against a predefined wordlist to speed up the cracking process with the following format:

    - `john <hashlist> –wordlist="wordlist.txt" `
    
      - Note that while a smaller wordlist may speed up the cracking process, if the wordlist doesn't contain the password, it will not be cracked.
    
    - There are many large wordlists available on the internet, but our distribution comes with a popular wordlist called `rockyou.txt`.

      - This wordlist is located in the `/usr/share/wordlists/` directory.

      - An example command to run with this wordlist looks like the following:

          - `john hashlist.txt –wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
    
  - This process can take a very long time on real files (hours, days, or even weeks or months), but the passwords in today's exercise should break quickly.

- You can see the passwords that `john` has already cracked by running:
  
     - `john --show <hashlist>`.

### 05: Privileges, root, sudo and su Demo

We've used `sudo` for several commands in the last two days of class.

- Every file and program on a Linux system has permissions associated with it. These permissions tell the system which user can access that file or run that program.

- Additionally, administrators can place users in a group, and set file and program permissions to allow a specific group or groups to have access.

- For instance, a company can create a group for employees who work in Marketing and another group for employees who work in Accounting. The administrator can give these groups access to specific programs needed by their department. 

- The permissions for a given file or program apply to all the users on the system, except for the root user.

- The root user is the super user, or the highest administrator on the system. The root user has complete access to the system and can perform any action, access any file, and run any program.

During the last activity, we learned just how sensitive the `/etc/shadow` file is. Typically, **only** the root user has access to this file. This is an example of how permissions can protect parts of the system.

When an attacker is trying to gain access to a system, they are usually trying to gain root access, or access to the root user, so they can do whatever they want to the system. Hackers can achieve this access by switching users.

#### Switching Users and Elevating Privileges

The Linux system can access different users with `su`:

- `su` stands for "switch user." If you have another user's password, you can log in as that user with `su <username>`.

- Switching users can be helpful for troubleshooting. You can see firsthand what the user has access to, and test their permissions. You can also see what they've been doing with the system from their perspective, with full access to their files.

- From a security perspective, switching users allows you to use the system with their permissions. This lets you run commands as that user, view files that only that user has access to, and otherwise imitate the user.

Linux systems secure root access with `sudo`.

- Properly secured Linux systems do not allow anyone to log in as the root user on the system. Instead, following the principle of least privilege, if a user needs access to something only the root user can do, they can use the `sudo` command to invoke the root user just for that one command.

- `sudo` stands for "superuser do", and if a normal user is allowed to use `sudo`, they can run a root-privileged command. When the command is complete, the user is reverted to their normal access.

- `sudo` can also control which commands the user can run as root user. This way, the system has granular control over who can run root commands, and which ones. It also keeps a log of exactly which user runs which commands, which can be reviewed as needed.

Note the following about configuring `sudo` access:

- `sudo` access is configured using a configuration file, the `sudoers` file.

- Inside that file, a `sudo` group is specified along with which commands `sudo` can be used with.

- The `sudo` group is typically given full system access to use `sudo`.

- Any user on the system that needs `sudo` access is then added as a member of the group. Any member of the group receives the same access and ability to use `sudo` for any command.

- Alternatively, a user can be kept out of the `sudo` group and added to the configuration file individually, along with a specification of which commands that user can use `sudo` for.

- Adding a user individually to the `sudo` configuration file is common when the sysadmin has a user that only needs `sudo` access for a few commands.

#### su vs. sudo Demonstration

In the next demo, we will attempt to update all of our existing software packages.

- If our privileges do not allow us to do so, we will first use `su` to switch directly to the root user.

- We'll then show the dangers of working directly as the root user.

- We'll then do the same updates by using `sudo` instead and show why this is the more secure option.

We will use the following commands to do these tasks:

  - `whoami` to view your current user.

  - `su` to switch to another user, in this case, the root user.

  - `sudo` to invoke the root user for one command only.

- Run `whoami` to show that you are the `instructor` user.

- Run `apt update` and note that this doesn't work.

  ```bash
  # apt update
  Reading package lists... Done
  E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (13: Permission denied)
  E: Unable to lock directory /var/lib/apt/lists/
  ```

- Only the root user has the ability to use the `apt` program. Because we are not `root`, we received a `Permissions denied` error.

- The `Permission denied` message indicates that you do not have permission to open a file (`/var/lib/apt/lists/lock`), and that you need to run `apt` with elevated privileges.

We will now log in as the root user with `su`, which again, stands for "switch user."

- Run `sudo su` (password: `instructor`)

- Run `whoami` to show that we are now `root`.

- The prompt now also uses a `#`, indicating that you are the root user. A standard user's prompt will generally show a `$`.

Now that we’re the root user, we can install packages.

- Run `apt update` as `root` and we should see the following:

  ```bash
  Hit:1 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic InRelease
  Get:2 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-security InRelease [88.7 kB]                     
  Get:3 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic InRelease [64.4 kB]                       
  Get:4 http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic-updates InRelease [88.7 kB] 
  ```

- This command updates the package repositories so we can download the latest software.

Once you, or a process, is logged in as `root`, you can make any changes you want to the system, including changes or malicious actions that may harm the system.

We will perform a quick example:

- Make sure you're (still) `root` with `sudo su` (password `instructor`) and do the following:

  - Run `ls /home` to show the current home folders.

  - Run `rm -r /home/john` to remove the home folder for `john`.

  - Run `ls home` again to show that it is removed.

  - Run `mkdir /home/john` to create a new empty `home` directory for `john`.

  - Lastly, run `chown -R john: /home/john` to give the user, `john`, ownership of their newly created home directory.

At no time during this process were you asked for a password.

- That is because you are the root user and you can perform any action you want, without the system stopping you.

- Not only is this a problem if you want to make system and software changes, but it's also a problem if you were to make a mistake and remove the wrong files.

Once you are logged in as another user, you can log out by typing `exit`.

- Run `exit`. This will log you out from the root user.

A better way to make the same changes is to use `sudo`.

- `sudo` usually and preferably prompts the user for a password, and it will only allow you to complete the actions you have access to.

- `sudo` adds a layer of security because it forces the administrator to consciously run a command with privileges.

- `sudo` also saves a log for each time the command is used. Therefore, an administrator can audit the log to find out which user did what.

Run `sudo apt update`. We have to first enter our password to use `sudo`.

Now we will try to delete a directory like we did previously:

- Run `ls /home` to show the current home folders.

- Run `rm -r /home/john`.

Your output should be similar to:

```bash
$ rm -r /home/john
rm: cannot rm directory ‘/home/john’: Permission denied
```

Restricting `sudo` use among users and only allowing access for specific commands reduces the risk of harm to the system.

#### Assigning sudo Access Demo

In the previous demo, we didn't have to log in as `root` because we could just use the `sudo` command to use the `apt` command.

If we want to see exactly what `sudo` access we have, we can run `sudo -l`.

- Run `sudo -l`. Your output should contain the line:

```bash
  User instructor may run the following commands on localhost:
      (ALL) ALL: ALL
```

- We, the instructor user, have `ALL` access.

We can check the privileges of a user with the `-lU` options. We can check the privileges of a user, `sally`, with the following command.

- Run `sudo -lU sally`. The output should be:

```bash
User sally is not allowed to run sudo on ubuntu-vm.
```

We can give `sally` full `sudo` access by adding her to the `sudo` group.

- Run `sudo usermod -aG sudo sally` to add Sally to the `sudo` group.

- Run `sudo -lU sally`. Your output should now read:

```bash
  User Sally may run the following commands on localhost:
      (ALL) ALL: ALL
```
- `sally` now has full access.

We can also give a user `sudo` access for just a single update. For example, we want to give our user `john` `sudo` access for `apt` so he can run software updates.

Why can't we just add `john` to the `sudo` group?

- This will give him full access to run any command, which we don't want.

Remember, the `sudo` settings are configured in the `/etc/sudoers` file.

To update the `/etc/sudoers` file, you must use the command `visudo`, which opens the `etc/sudoers` file using Nano.

  - Using `visudo` to edit this file is necessary because `visudo` does a syntax check on the `sudoers` file before it is saved to prevent corruption of the file.

  - Breaking this file can lock you out of the system entirely, so you want to be sure to always use `visudo` to edit the file.

  - :warning: **Troubleshooting Help**:  If you break this file and get locked out of using `sudo`, review the following thread: 
    - [Ask Ubuntu: How to Modify an Invalid etc Sudoers File](https://askubuntu.com/questions/73864/how-to-modify-an-invalid-etc-sudoers-file).

Run `sudo visudo`.

Scroll down to find the following lines at the bottom of the file:

  ```bash
  # User privilege specification
  root  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

  # Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
  %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL

  # Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
  %sudo  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
  ```

- `root  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`: Allow the root user to run any command under any user or group on any system.

- `%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL`: Allow all members of the `admin` group to run any command with `sudo` under any user on any system.

- `%sudo  ALL=(ALL) ALL`: Allow all members of the `sudo` group to run any command with `sudo` under any user on any system.

The general syntax of these lines are as follows:

- [`USER` or %`GROUP`]  `HOST`=(`USER`:`GROUP`) `COMMAND`

  - The `HOST` is normally set to `ALL` but can be changed if the administrator wants to limit which machines can use this file.

- For a group entry, the `GROUP` inside the parenthesis can be left out: %`GROUP` `HOST`=(`USER`) `COMMAND`

- To remove the password requirement, `NOPASSWD` is added: `USER` `HOST`=(`USER`) `NOPASSWD`: `COMMAND`

This means any user in the secondary group `sudo` _or_ `admin` can use `sudo` to run privileged commands with their password.

Add the line `john  ALL=(ALL:ALL) /usr/bin/apt`.

- This allows the user `john` to run the `apt` command with `sudo` as the `root` user, on any `host` after entering his password.

- `john` now has access to run the `apt` command and update software packages.

Save and exit.

Verify your new settings.

- Run `sudo -lU john`

- Output should look like:

    ```bash
     User john may run the following commands on localhost:
      ALL=(ALL:ALL) /usr/bin/apt
    ```

#### Attackers Gaining Root Access Demo

Even when `sudo` use is restricted to specific commands, depending on the command, a user can still gain access to `root`.

In this last demo, we will pretend we are an attacker and attempt to gain root access from an account that has `sudo` access to one of these commands.

There are several different commands for which this can be a problem, but today we will look at the `less` command.

Let's return to our example of `john`. In addition to allowing `john` the ability to install software, we may also want to allow him to read any of the sensitive files on the system using `less`.

- `less`, however, has a feature that allows you to run commands without exiting the `less` command, and those commands are run with the same privileges that `less` has.

  - In other words, if a user has `sudo` access for `less`, they can open `less` and then start running commands from inside `less` with `sudo` privileges.

To demonstrate this, we will use `sudo less` with the admin user and then move from `less` directly into a root shell with `!bash`.

- Run `sudo visudo` and edit the entry for `john` to give him `sudo` access to `less`.

- Output should look like:

```
    john ALL=(ALL:ALL) /usr/bin/apt, /usr/bin/less
```
Save and exit.

Now we will run `sudo less` on any file that belongs to John:

- Run `su john` (password: `lakers`) to switch to John's user.

- Run `touch /home/john/my_file`.

- Run `sudo less /home/john/my_file`.

Because we ran `less` with the `sudo` command, when we are inside `less` we are no longer `john`. Instead, we are now `root`.

To run a command from inside `less`, we use `!` followed by the command.

We can run any command with `less`, but it makes the most sense to run `bash`. This command will launch another shell from inside `less` with your current root privileges.

- Type `!bash` and press Enter to drop into a root shell.

We now have a `#` at the prompt again, indicating we have root privileges.

- Run `whoami` to confirm that you are `root`.

Attackers often look for this kind of loophole to escalate their privileges on a system.

- This kind of exploit is called an **escape** exploit because you are escaping the program `less` and getting full system access.

- It's important to restrict which commands users can use with `sudo` in `/etc/sudoers` and to always make sure there are no known vulnerabilities with the commands you do allow.

#### Summary

- `whoami` to determine your current user.

- `su` to switch to another user, in this case the root user.

- `sudo` to invoke the root user for one command only.

- `sudo -l` to list the `sudo` privileges for a user.

- `visudo` to edit the `sudoers` file.

### 07. Activity Review: sudo Wrestling

- [Solution Guide: Sudo Wrestling](Activities/06_Sudo_Wrestling/Solved/README.md) 

### 08. Break

### 09. Users and Groups

We will now discuss users and groups in more depth. As a quick review:

- Linux is a multi-user OS and related users can be added to groups.

- We briefly discussed this when we spoke about the `sudo` and `admin` groups.

- In the case of `sudo`, all users added to the `sudo` or `admin` groups have full access to `sudo`.

Linux has the ability to create groups of users for other functions like file or services sharing.

- If a company has different departments like Sales, Accounting and Marketing, a Linux administrator can create a group for each department. Only the users in the group can access files owned by the group.

- Therefore, a system admin must know how to to add and remove users from a system, add and remove groups, and add and remove users from those groups.

Linux has a few easy commands that are used specifically for user and group management, which we will focus on in this section.

Before diving into these commands, we’ll cover how Linux identifies users and groups in the system using the `id` command. 

- Linux associates a specific number to each user for identification purposes. This number is called a **user ID** or **UID**.

- When Linux needs to identify a user, it doesn’t look at the username, it uses the UID number.

- System users, or automated users designed to complete system tasks, have UIDs assigned at numbers less than 1000.

- Standard users, or users that are assigned to a real person, have UIDs assigned at numbers greater than 1000.

- The root user always has the UID of 0.

- Likewise, the **GID** is the **group ID** that is associated with a group.

  - Our UID is above 1000, which indicates that we are a standard user.

We can also see the UID for each user in the `/etc/passwd file`.

- Run `head /etc/passwd`.

  - The system UIDs start with `root` at 0, and move up from there.

UIDs and GIDs are only a system number that Linux uses for identification. If we want to see the groups that a user belongs to, we can use the command `groups`.

- Run `groups`.

  - Note that it prints your user's groups to the screen.

- Run `id`.

  - This also shows us the groups along with the GIDs assigned to them.

#### Users and Groups Demo

In the upcoming demo, we’ll dive into more actions around user and group management, using the following scenario:

- The company you work for recently had a change to its developer team. Mike, a lead developer, has left the company. Joseph has joined as a new junior developer.

- The company's Linux system has never been set up properly with a `developers` group. Instead, Mike was part of the `general` group.

- As the sysadmin for this system, you need to remove Mike from the `general` group, remove the `general` group, and delete Mike's user from the system. Then, you need to add Joseph to the system, create a `developers` group, and add Joseph to this group.

To accomplish these tasks, you will:

1. Get group info for Mike's user using the command `groups`.

2. Lock Mike's account to prevent him from logging in using the command `usermod`.

3. Remove the `mike` user from the `general` group with the command `usermod`.

4. Delete the `mike` user by using the command `deluser --remove-home`.

5. Delete the `general` group using the command `delgroup`.

6. Create a `joseph` user with the command `adduser`.

7. Create a `developer` group using the command `addgroup`.

8. Add the `joseph` user to the `developer` group using the command `usermod`.

First, we'll see what groups Mike belongs to.

- Run `groups mike` to print Mike's groups to the screen.

- Your output should be:

  ```bash
  $ groups mike
  mike general
  ```

Each user is also a member of a group that shares the name of the user.

- When a user is created, Linux by default creates a group of which that user becomes a member.

The `usermod` command has many different options and lets us do many things to user accounts, but we are going to look at the `-L` and `-G` options. The `-L` option will lock the account and the `-G` option will specify the groups a user should belong to.

- Run `sudo usermod -L mike` to lock the account.

  - `sudo`: Only `root` can modify users and groups, so we will have to use `sudo` for all of our commands.

  - `usermod`: Allows us to make many modifications to users. In this case, we are using it to add and remove groups.

  - `-L`: `usermod` flag that locks an account so it cannot be logged into.

  - `mike`: The `usermod` command always ends with the user we are modifying.

- Run `sudo usermod -G mike mike` to remove `mike` from the `general` group.

  - `sudo`: Only `root` can modify users and groups, so we will have to use `sudo` for all of our commands.

  - `usermod`: Allows us to make many modifications to users. In this case, we are using it to add and remove groups.

  - `-G`: This `usermod` flag specifies which groups the user should belong to. The groups that we specify following this command will be the only groups that user belongs to after we run the command.

  - `mike`: Following the `-G` flag are the groups we want the user to belong to. In this case, we want the user `mike` to be a member of the `mike` group only, effectively removing the `general` group.

  - `mike`: The `usermod` command always ends with the user we are modifying.

- Run `groups mike` to confirm the result.

  - Your output should be:

    ```bash
    $ groups mike
    mike
    ```

  - Mike has successfully been removed from the `general` group.

We can now remove the Mike user from the system using the `deluser` command.

- Run `sudo deluser --remove-home mike`  

  - `sudo`: Only `root` can modify users and groups, so we will have to use `sudo` for all of our commands.

  - `deluser`: Allows us to delete users from the system.

  - `--remove-home`: `deluser` flag that removes the user's home folder along with the user.

  - `mike`: The `deluser` command always ends with the user we want to delete.

If we use the `deluser` command without any flags, it will leave all of Mike's files intact including his home folder. In this case, we will remove the user _and_ all of his home folder files.

- Run `ls /home` to confirm your results.

  - Mike's home folder has been deleted.

Do you remember how to verify users or groups on the system?

- You can check for users in the `/etc/passwd` file with `grep <user name> /etc/passwd`.

- You can check for groups in the `/etc/group` file with `grep <group name> /etc/group`.

  - Run `grep mike /etc/passwd` to verify that `mike` is deleted.

  - Run `grep general /etc/group`.

  - The `general` group still exists. The line for the `general` group should look like this:

    ```bash
    general:x:32:
    ```

  - If this group had any members, they would be listed after the last colon (`:`). In this case, there are no members left in this group.

We can now remove the `general` group with the `delgroup`.

- Run `sudo delgroup general`.

  - Run `grep general /etc/group` to verify it is gone.

Now we will create our new user, `joseph`.

- Run `sudo adduser joseph` and complete the prompts to give `joseph` a password and other info.

- Run `groups joseph` to display the `joseph` group.

   Your output should look like:

  ```bash
  $ groups joseph
  joseph
  ```

Remember, when a user is added to the system, by default a group by the same name is added. Also, when a user is deleted, their group is also deleted, as long as no other users are members of that group.

Next, we will create a new developer group using the `addgroup` command. Then we can add the user `joseph` to the group.

- Run `sudo addgroup developers`.

We received a `Done` message, but we can also verify this group was added in the `/etc/group` file.

- Run `tail /etc/group`.

- **Note:** Since our new groups will be the last line in the `group` file, using `tail` is easier and quicker than `grep` in this case.

  - We can now see both the new `joseph` group that was created when we added the user `joseph`, as well as the new `developers` group.

We are now ready to add `joseph` to the `developers` group using the `usermod` command.

- Run `sudo usermod -aG developers joseph`. 

  - `sudo`: Only `root` can modify users and groups, so we will have to use `sudo` for all of our commands.

  - `usermod`: Allows us to make many modifications to users. In this case, we are using it to add and remove groups.

  - `-aG`: This `usermod` flag combination (_add group_) specifies which groups the user should be added to.

  - `developers`: Following the `-aG` flag are the groups we want to add the user to. In this case, we want to add the user `joseph` to the `developers` group.

  - `joseph`: The `usermod` command always ends with the user we are modifying.

- Run `groups joseph`.

  - Joseph is now part of the `developer` group as a secondary group.

- Your output should be:

  ```bash
  $ groups joseph
  joseph : joseph developers
  ```

- We have now created the `joseph` user, created the `developers` group and added `joseph` to it.

A user always has a primary group that is typically the same name as the user. The primary group can be changed to another group, but there isn't usually a reason to do so.

Groups that a user is added to beyond the primary group are known as `secondary` groups. A user can be a member of unlimited secondary groups.

Summary:

1. Received group info for the `mike` user with the command `groups`.

2. Used `usermod` to lock the `mike` user account to prevent him from logging into our system.

3. Removed the `mike` user from the `general` group using the command `usermod`.

4. Deleted the `mike` user by using the command `deluser --remove-home`.

5. Deleted the `general` group using the command `delgroup`.

6. Created a `joseph` user by using the command `adduser`.

7. Created a `developer` group using the command `addgroup`.

8. Added the `joseph` user to the `developer` group using the command `usermod`.
