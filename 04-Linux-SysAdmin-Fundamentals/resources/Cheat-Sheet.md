## Key Terms
- **Operating System**: Also known as an OS, this is a platform that allows users to install and run applications, such as web browsers and text editors.
  > **Example**: Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux are all examples of operating systems.

- **FOSS**: **free, open source software (FOSS)**. This means that anyone can read or modify its **source code**.
  > **Example**: Linux is free and open source specifically because Windows and Unix, its early competitor, were not. In other words, Linux was developed for researchers and students in direct response to the fact that Windows and Unix were extremely expensive and/or inaccessible in the early days of computing.

- **Linux Distribution**: Because Linux is FOSS, many different people have developed their own special-purpose variants of the operating system. These variants are called **distributions**.
  > **Example**: There are many different distributions in use today. In this course, students will use two: **Ubuntu** and **Kali Linux**.

- **Headless Servers**: Most production Linux servers don't even offer a graphical interfaceâ€”they can _only_ be used from the command line. Such command line-only machines are called **headless servers**.
  > **Example**: Headless servers are the norm because by today's standards, the CLI requires _very_ little resources. This gives the server maximum resources to run it's services and applications, so a GUI based system is neither required nor desirable.

- **System-wide Configurations**: While normal users can only modify their own local configurations, an administrator can make changes that apply to _all_ users of the system. These are called **system-wide configurations**, and apply to every user on the system.
  > **Example**: An administrator might configure a machine to prevent people from browsing to `https://facebook.com`. This would apply to _all_ users of the system, making it a system-level configuration.

- **Password Hash**. This is a string that is _different_ from the user's password, which the operating system can still use to check that they've entered the correct password to log in.
  > **Example**: A hash is a cryptographic function that changes the password to an unintelligible string of characters so it is not easily read or used by an attacker. `$6$6Y/fI1nx$zQJj6AH9asTNfhxV7NoVgxByJyE.rVKK6tKXiOGNCfWBsrTGY7wtC6Cep6co9eVNkRFrpK6koXs1NU3AZQF8v/` is an example of a hash

- **/etc/passwd**: This file contains a list of registered users on the system. Contrary to its name, it contains no information about user passwords.
  > **Example**: This means that attackers who steal `/etc/passwd` will get a list of users to attack, but will _not_ be able to steal their passwords.

- **/etc/shadow**: This file contains both a list of usernames _and_ information about their passwords.  
  > **Example**: Specifically, it stores the password hashes.

-  **System Process**: A program that is _running_ is called a **process**, because it is in the _process_ of performing its task.
  > **Example**: When a program runs, it must process data, and potentially make changes to the file system. For example, a text editing application needs to save temporary files to backup users' work, and then save their final draft to a file on disk.

- **PID**: The `Process ID`. Every running process on the system is assigned a `PID` by the system, so the system can keep track of which process is which.
  > **Example**: The PID for a process is shown with commands like `top` and `ps`. When you want to stop a process, you would often use the `PID` along with the `kill` command. e.g. `kill 947`

- **/etc/security/pwquality.conf**: The file that contains the rules for all passwords created on the system.
  > **Example**: Edit this file to require users to create stronger passwords.

- **Package Manager**: To install software on a Linux system, Linux has a program called a **package manager**. Administrators often have no choice but to install additional software to properly harden the machines they manage.
  > **Example**: The package manager used by Ubuntu is called aptitude. You use aptitude with the command `apt`.

- **Repository**: When you install a package with `apt`, Linux searches special databases to find information about `<package name>`. If it finds it, it will download and install the package. These databases are known as **repositories**.
  > **Example** Repositories specifically used to store and distribute packages are known as **Personal Package Archives**, or **PPAs**. PPAs are simply servers where Linux software is stored and maintained.

- **Access Controls**: These controls determine the actions that users are able to do to a file (edit, view, etc.).
  > **Example**: Google Docs is a fantastic example of access controls at work because we can choose who we share files with and what permission they have when they receive the file, such as whether they can only read or make edits to it.

- **Discretionary Access Control**: Also known as `DAC`. It is called discretionary, because the owner of an item can specify what other users can access the item. In other words, Access control is based on the discretion of the owner.
  > **Example**: A directory may pass on it's permissions to items inside it.

- **Mandatory Access Control**: Also known as `MAC` - This differs from `DAC` because with `MAC` the system decides what users have access to what items. Each user is given a certain level of clearance that allows them to access certain types of files
  > **Example**: SELinux is a mandatory access control system.

- **Permissions** regulate _who_ can take which actions. For example, Jane can read and write, but John can only read.
  > **Example**: On a Linux system permissions are set for each file or directory.

- **File Permissions**: The set of 10 permissions flags assigned to every file/directory.
  > **Example**: -rwxrwxrwx - The first flag represents the file type. If it is a directory, a 'd' is shown. If it is a file, a `-` is shown. The remaining 9 flags are comprised of 3 groups of `rwx`. `r` for `read`, `w` for `write` and `x` for `execute`. Each of the 3 sets of letters represent an entity and it's respective `read`, `write`, and `execute` permissions for that file/directory. The first set of `rwx` represent the `owner's permissions`. The second set of `rwx` represent the `group's permissions` and the third set of `rwx` represents the permissions of all other users on the system. The letters in each set of `rwx` never change position. If a certain permission is missing it is represented by a `-`. e.g. `drwxr-xr--` shows a directory where the owner has full permissions to read, write and execute, the group can read and execute but not write, and all other users can only read.

- **File or Directory Owner**: The 'owner' is the main user assigned to a file or directory.
  > **Example**: The owner of a file/directory is usually the user that created said file/directory. When looking at a file/directory's permissions, the owner's permissions are represented by the first set of `rwx` listed. When you create a file or directory, you become the `owner` of that file or directory. If a program creates a file/directory, the owner of the file/directory is not the program, but rather the user that started the program.

- **File or Directory Group**: The 'group' of users or programs assigned to a file or directory.
  > **Example**: The group of a file or directory represents all users that are a member of that group. In other words, it represents an entire group of users. When viewing a file/directory's permissions, the group's permissions are represented by the second set `rwx` letters.


- **File or Directory Other/World**: A category that represents all 'other' users on a system.
  > **Example**: The Other/World category of a file/directory represents any user that is not in the group assigned to the file/directory, and it is not the owner of that file/directory. In other words, it is any other user that is not directly associated with that file/directory. When viewing a file/directory's permissions, the 'Other/World' permissions are represented by the third set `rwx` letters.

- **SUID**: The `Set User ID` special permissions bit. This bit is only used on files that have the `x` bit set in the owner position. In other words, it is only used on executable files or programs.
  > **Example**: It causes the executable to behave as if the `owner` executed the file, regardless of what user on the system executed it.

- **SGID**: The `Set Group ID` special permissions bit. This bit can be used on both directories and executable files that have the `x` permissions set for the group position. However, `SGID` is _rarely_ used on executable files.
  > **Example**: When used on a file, the executable behaves as if the owner who executes the file were a member of the file's group even if they are not. When used on a directory, anything created inside said directory will be assigned the same group as the directory instead of being assigned the primary group of the owner.

- **Sticky**: The `sticky` special permissions bit. The `Sticky` bit is only used on directories that have the `x` permission set for the `other` position.
  > **Example**: The `Sticky` bit causes the directory to allow anyone on the system to create files in said directory, and it allows anyone on the system to delete files in said directory, but _only_ if those files belong to the user. In other words, a user cannot delete files that belong to other users inside the directory.

- **Symbolic Notation**: When changing a file/directory's permissions the letters `r`, `w`, and `x` are used directly within a command.
  > **Example**: `+x` would add execute privileges and `-w` would remove write privileges.

- **Octal Notation**: When changing a file/directory's permissions numbers are used to represent the respective `r`, `w`, and `x`.
  > **Example**: Each letter in a group of `rwx` is assigned a number if you want to set it. `r` always equals 4, `w` always equals 2, and `x` always equals 1. If you don't want to set that permission, it's value is 0. The octal notation is the sum of the values assigned to each letter. If you want to set permissions to only read, the number is 4. If you want to read and write, add the numbers for `r` and `w` together and the number is 6. If you want read and execute, the number is 5. `rwx` would be equal to 7. This way, you can represent the permissions of the user, group and other with just 3 numbers. e.g. 755 would translate to rwxr-xr-x.

- **Service User**: A system user who's sole purpose is to run _one_ service. This keeps services from running as the root user and generally keeps the system more secure.
  > **Example**: A service such as `Apache` will automatically install it's own user when the package is installed. If a service does not have it's own user, a user should be created for it so it can run without root privileges.

### Key Commands

#### General Commands

<ul>
  <li> `ls` List all the items in a directory
  <li> `cd` Change directory
  <li> `mv` Move a file
  <li> `cp` Copy a file
  <li> `less` Read a file with pagination
  <li> `head` View the top 10 lines of a file
  <li> `tail` View the bottom 10 lines of a file
  <li> `>` Redirect the output of a command into a file
  <li> `mkdir` Create a directory
  <li> `rm` Remove a file or a directory
  <li> `whoami` Display the current user name
  <li> `groups` Display the groups for a user
  <li> `man` Open the manual for a command
</ul>

#### ls -l

List the 'long' form of files and directories in your present working directory.

```bash
#List 'all' the files in 'long' form with 'human' readable file sizes.
ls -alh
```
This is used to see the permissions of files/directories, the username and group of the file/directory owner, the file/directory size in bytes and the time of it's last modification.

#### Kill and Killall

Kill is used for killing a process using the process ID. Killall is used to kill _all_ the processes started by the same program. Killall uses the process name.

```bash
#Kill process with the ID 436
kill 436

#Kill all processes started by the chrome program
killall chrome
```
By default `kill` allows the process to stop what it's doing and wrap things up before is stops. If you want to 'pull the plug' on a program and kill it immediately, use the `-9` option.

```bash
# kill process with the id 567 immediately
kill -9 567
```

#### Apt-get and Apt

Apt-get is the standard command to install packages on all Debian based systems. `apt` is a shorthand version that works the same way. If you want the package to be installed without further questioning from the system, you can use the `-y` flag

```bash
# Install the nano package
sudo apt-get install nano

# Install the top package without asking for confirmation
sudo apt-get -y install top
```

#### Nano and text editors

Nano is a basic text editor in Linux. There are other text editors listed here as well for you to try. If you decide to try these, google them first to learn about how they work. The man pages are also a good resource.

```bash
# open my_doc.txt with the nano text editor
nano my_doc.txt

# open my_doc.txt with the gedit text editor
gedit my_doc.txt

# open my_doc.txt with the vi text editor
vi my_doc.txt

# open my_doc.txt with the emacs text editor
emacs my_doc.txt

```
#### sudo

Stands for 'Super User Do'. It's the command you have to use if you want to invoke the system permissions of the root user (also known as the super user).

```bash
# Show the contents of the /etc/shadow file
sudo cat /etc/shadow
```
```bash
# Update the list of programs offered in the `apt` repository
sudo apt update
```
Many files/directories are only accessible by the root user. Also many programs require root permissions to run. If you are not logged in as root, you either have to switch your login to the root user, or you can use `sudo` command to run a single command with root permissions. Note: In order to use the 'sudo' command, your user has to be part of the 'sudo' group.

You can see what commands are available for your user with the `-l` flag
```bash
# Print the available sudo commands for the current user
sudo -l
```
If you want to see what commands are available for another user, add the `-U` flag and the username

```bash
# Print the available sudo commands for the user mike
sudo -lU mike
```
#### su

Stands for 'Switch User'. If you do not specify a user to switch to, the default is root.

```bash
# Switch to user mike
su mike

# Switch your login to the root user and 'preserve' your current environment.
su -p
```
#### visudo

You _must_ use `visudo` to edit the `/etc/sudoers` file.

```bash
# Edit the /etc/sudoers file and validate that it is not damaged before saving.
sudo visudo -c
```

#### chage

Chage allows an administrator to set expirations on passwords, along with setting how many days before the next password change.

To see all of the chage info for a user, use the `-l` flag

```bash
# look at the chage info for the user mike
sudo chage -l mike
```

To set the `Maximum number of days between password changes` use the `-M` flag

```bash
# set the password to expire after 90 days for the user mike
chage -M 90 mike
```

To set the password to expire immediately, use the `-d` flag with the value `0`

```bash
# set the password to expire immediately for the user mike
chage -d 0 mike
```

#### id

The id command gives you the UID, GID, and group information for a user.

```bash
#Show the UID, GID, and group information for user randal.
id randal
```
If no user is specified, the current user's info is displayed.

#### adduser

`adduser` makes it easy to add a user with their password and user info.

```bash
# Add a new user with the username 'ralph'
sudo adduser ralph
```

If you want to create a system user use the `--system` option to give the user a `UID` < 1000.
Use the `--no-create-home` option to avoid creating a home folder.

```bash
# Create a system user named http without creating a home folder
sudo adduser --system --no-create-home http
```

#### addgroup

addgroup allows you to make and create groups on the system.

```bash
# Create a new group named 'developers'
addgroup developers
```

#### usermod

usermod allows you to change many parameters of a user. It is typically used to change a user's primary group, or add/remove secondary groups.

```bash
# Add the user bertha to the group hr_administrators
usermod -aG hr_administrators bertha

# Remove the user jack from all groups except the jack group
sudo usermod -G jack jack
```

#### deluser

deluser allows you to easily delete a user from the system. If you would like to also remove their home folder and files, use the `--remove-home` flag

```bash
# remove the user torbin from the system and delete his home folder
sudo deluser --remove-home torbin
```

#### delgroup

delgroup lets you easily remove a group from the system

```bash
# remove the slackers group from the system
sudo delgroup slackers
```

#### chmod

You change permissions with the command `chmod`, which stands for "change mode".

```bash
# Change the permissions to rwx for the user, rw- for the group and --- for everyone else.
chmod u+rwx,g=rw,o= permissions_file
```

You can also use chmod with octal notation to set permissons.
```bash
# Change the permissions to rwx for the user, rw- for the group and --- for everyone else.
chmod 760 permissions_file
```

#### chown

Stands for 'change owner'. When you change the owner, you also have to specify the group that you are assigning.

```bash
# Change the owner to bernard and the group to finance for the file spreadsheet
chown bernard:finance spreadsheet
```
Anything else about the Command

#### Passwd

The `passwd` command lets you change the password for a user.

```bash
#change the password for the user maxwell
sudo passwd maxwell
```

#### Find

Find is a great search tool to search for any files or folders on the system. To specify between files or folders, user the `-type` flag along with `f` for files or `d` for directories.

```bash
# find all _files_ in the /etc directory
find /etc -type f

# find all _directories_ in the /etc directory
find /etc -type d
```

If you would like to search for a string in the name of the file, use the `-iname` flag along with the `-type` flag

```bash
# find a file with 'shadow' in the name inside the /etc directory
find /etc -iname shadow -type f
```

To search for files with particular permissions, use the `-perm` flag

```bash
# search for files that have the 2000 (SGID) bit set inside /usr/bin
 find /usr/bin -perm /2000 -type f

# search for files that have the 4000 (SUID) bit set inside /usr/bin
find /usr/bin -perm /4000 -type f
```

#### Systemctl

systemctl allows you to start, stop, enable, disable and get the status of a service, as well as view all the services installed and running on the system. To get the status of a service use `status` and to see all the services, use `-t` for type along with `service` and `--all` to get everything on the system.

```bash
# search for _all_ services that are currently running on the system
systemctl -t service --all

# get the status of the apache2 service
sudo systemctl status apache2

```

If you want to start or stop a service, simply use `start` or `stop` flags

```bash
# start the apache2 service
sudo systemctl start apache2

# stop the apache2 service from running
sudo systemctl stop apache2
```

systemctl allows you to `enable` and `disable` a service from starting automatically when the system boots up. To set either of these, simply use `enable` or `disable`

```bash
# stop the apache2 service from starting automatically when the system starts up
sudo systemctl disable apache2

# set the apache2 service to start automatically when the system starts up
sudo systemctl enable apache2
```
